        "abstract": "In many platforms, user arrivals exhibit a self-reinforcing behavior: future user arrivals are likely to have preferences similar to users who were satisfied in the past. In other words, arrivals exhibit positive externalities. We study multiarmed bandit (MAB) problems with positive externalities. We show that the self-reinforcing preferences may lead standard benchmark algorithms such as UCB to exhibit linear regret. We develop a new algorithm, Balanced Exploration (BE), which explores arms carefully to avoid suboptimal convergence of arrivals before sufficient evidence is gathered. We also introduce an adaptive variant of BE which successively eliminates suboptimal arms. We analyze their asymptotic regret, and establish optimality by showing that no algorithm can perform better."

    "summary": [
        "A number of different platforms use multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms today to optimize their service: e.g., search engines and information retrieval platforms; e-commerce platforms; and news sites.",
        "Because of the positive externality, this choice causes the user population to shift entirely to users preferring arm a\u21e4 over time; in particular, the oracle achieves asymptotically optimal performance to leading order in T .",
        "In Section 5, we show that the UCB algorithm is not only suboptimal, but has positive probability of never obtaining a reward on the best arm a\u21e4\u2014and obtains linear regret.",
        "(The remainder of our paper characterizes upper and lower bounds on performance as the time horizon T grows large.) We let T denote the total reward accrued up to time T : X T T = Xt. The goal of the platform is to choose a sequence {It} to maximize E[ T ].",
        "We devote this section to developing structural insight into the model, by characterizing the performance of two classical approaches for the standard stochastic MAB problem: the UCB algorithm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and a random-explore--commit algorithm.",
        "We first show that the standard upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, which does not account for the positive externality, performs poorly.",
        "The impact of this selfreinforcement under UCB is so severe that we obtain a striking result: there is a strictly positive probability that the optimal arm a\u21e4 will never see a positive reward, as shown by the following theorem.",
        "We use a natural modification of this algorithm called Balanced Exploration with Arm Elimination (BE-AE) that achieves the lower bound in Theorem 1, though it uses some knowledge of system parameters in doing so.",
        "The BE policy is cautious during the exploration phase in the following sense: it pulls the arm with least accrued reward, to give it further opportunity to ramp up its score just in case its poor performance was bad luck.",
        "Note that this algorithm only uses prior knowledge of the time horizon T , but no other system parameters; in particular, we do not need information on the strength of the positive externality, captured by \u21b5.",
        "We present an algorithm which eliminates the inflation in regret by intelligently eliminating arms that have poor performance during the exploration phase by using upper and lower confidence bounds.",
        "The following theorem shows that the BE-AE algorithm achieves optimal regret, i.e., it meets the lower bounds in Theorem 1.",
        "We simulate our model with m = 2 arms, with externality strength \u21b5 = 1, arm reward parameters each algorithm one \u03bc1"
