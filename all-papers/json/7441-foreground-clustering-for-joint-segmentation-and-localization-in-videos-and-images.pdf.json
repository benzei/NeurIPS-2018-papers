        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework in which video/image segmentation and localization are cast into a single optimization problem that integrates information from low level appearance cues with that of high level localization cues in a very weakly supervised manner. The proposed framework leverages two representations at different levels, exploits the spatial relationship between bounding boxes and superpixels as linear constraints and simultaneously discriminates between foreground and background at bounding box and superpixel level. Different from previous approaches that mainly rely on discriminative clustering, we incorporate a foreground model that minimizes the histogram difference of an object across all image frames. Exploiting the geometric relation between the superpixels and bounding boxes enables the transfer of segmentation cues to improve localization output and vice-versa. Inclusion of the foreground model generalizes our discriminative framework to video data where the background tends to be similar and thus, not discriminative. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework on the YouTube Object video dataset, Internet Object Discovery dataset and Pascal VOC 2007."

        "We briefly review the two main components of the discriminative frameworks (14; 42; 16) used for cosegmentation and colocalization as we build on the following two components: Discriminative clustering.",
        "With the success of deep networks, supervised top down segmentation methods obtain impressive performance by learning on pixel level (28; 35) or bounding box labelled datasets (10; 12).",
        "We use very weak supervision to imply that labels are given only at the image or video level and aim to jointly segment and localize the foreground object given the weak supervision.",
        "Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a novel framework that simultaneously learns to localize and segment common objects in images and videos.",
        "All these approaches require ground truth annotation either in the form of bounding boxes or segmented objects or do not exploit the similarity between the two tasks.",
        "Weak supervision in image domain dates back to image cosegmentation (38; 14; 31; 18) and colocalization problem where one segments or localizes common foreground regions out of a set of images.",
        "Most of the approaches (22; 13) leverage a large set of videos to discriminate or build a foreground model.",
        "For each bounding box i, the constraint [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] relates the two indexing of superpixels, xi and y, by a projection matrix Pi defined earlier.",
        "If the discriminative localization part considers some bounding box zi to be background and sets it to close to 0, this , in principle, enforces the segmentation part that superpixels in this bounding box are more likely to be background (= 0)as defined by the right hand side of Eq 8: j\u2208Si xij \u2264 \u03b4|Si|zi.",
        "We empirically validate and show that learning the two problems jointly significantly improve the performance over learning them individually and demonstrate the effectiveness of foreground model within the discriminative framework.",
        "YouTube Object Dataset is a benchmark dataset for unsupervised video segmentation and provides pixel level annotations for a subset of videos.",
        "Baseline Methods We analyze individual components of our colocalization model by removing various terms in the objective function and consider the following baselines: LP(Sal.) This baseline only minimizes the saliency term for bounding boxes and picks the most salient one in each frame of video.",
        "In addition to the stripped down version of our model, we compare with FST [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] which is still considered state of the art on unsupervised Youtube Object segmentation dataset.",
        "In addition to the baseline proposed above in video colocalization by removing various terms in the objective function, we consider the following baselines: Baseline Methods Tang et al(TJLF14) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] tackles colocalization alone without any segmentation spatial support.",
        "Optimizing the current using the recently proposed large scale discriminative clustering framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] is left as a future work"
