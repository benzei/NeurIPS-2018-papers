        "abstract": "We consider stochastic settings for clustering, and develop provably-good (approximation) algorithms for a number of these notions. These algorithms allow one to obtain better approximation ratios compared to the usual deterministic clustering setting. Additionally, they offer a number of advantages including providing fairer clustering and clustering which has better long-term behavior for each user. In particular, they ensure that every user is guaranteed to get good service (on average). We also complement some of these with impossibility results."

    "summary": [
        "Clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data science.",
        "While optimal approximation algorithms for the center-type problems are well-known, all of the current algorithms give deterministic solutions.",
        "We study generalized variants of the center-type problems where S is drawn from a probability distribution over; we refer to these as k-lotteries.",
        "In data clustering settings where a user corresponds to a datapoint, this means that every point j \u2208 C should be guaranteed a good value of d(j, S).",
        "This is essentially what k-center type problems are aiming for, but the stochastic setting broadens the meaning of good per-user service.",
        "In Section 2, we encounter the first type of approximation algorithm which we refer to as chance k-coverage: namely, where every client j has a distance demand rj and probability demand pj, and we wish to find a distribution satisfying Pr[d(j, S) \u2264 rj] \u2265 pj.",
        "The works [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] focus on approximately satisfying the knapsack constraints; this is very different from the problem of opening exactly k cluster centers, which we mostly cover here.",
        "We use a similar type of algorithm to that considered in Section 2.2: we choose a covering set of clusters C , and we open exactly one item from each cluster.",
        "In the SCC setting, we may improve the approximation ratio using the following Algorithm 5; it is the same as Algorithm 4, except that we have moved some values of b to the cluster centers.",
        "The SCC setting, in which all the values of rj are equal, is equivalent to the classical k-center problem.",
        "Assuming P = N P , there is no algorithm running in polynomial time which guarantees a set-cover solution X with SX = [n] and |X| \u2264 (1 \u2212 ) ln n \u00d7 OPT, where > 0 is any constant.",
        "Assuming P = N P , there is no polynomial-time algorithm which guarantees a set-cover solution X with |X| \u2264 OPT and SX \u2265 cn for any constant c > 1 \u2212 1/e.",
        "If a polynomial-time algorithm A generates a distribution \u03a9 which ensures that E[d(j, X)] \u2264 crj, it generates a solution a fraction (3 \u2212 c)/2 of the sets in B.",
        "Assuming P = N P , no polynomial-time algorithm can take as input a feasible vector r, p for the chance k-coverage problem and generate a k-lottery \u03a9 guaranteeing either PrS\u223c\u03a9[d(j, S) < rj] \u2265 (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 )pj, or PrS\u223c\u03a9[d(j, S) < 3rj] \u2265 pj, for any constant > 0."
