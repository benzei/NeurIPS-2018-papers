        "abstract": "We introduce a novel deep-learning inspired formulation of the phase retrieval problem, which asks to recover a signal y0 2 Rn from m quadratic observations, under structural assumptions on the underlying signal. As is common in many imaging problems, previous methodologies have considered natural signals as being sparse with respect to a known basis, resulting in the decision to enforce a generic sparsity prior. However, these methods for phase retrieval have encountered possibly fundamental limitations, as no computationally efficient algorithm for sparse phase retrieval has been proven to succeed with fewer than O k2 n"

        "Our results illustrate that these priors are, 2with respect to the dimensionality of the latent code given to the generative network in reality, less limiting in terms of sample complexity, both by providing more compressibility and by being able to be more tightly enforced.",
        "Another non-convex method, SPARTA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>], estimates the support of the signal for its initialization and performs hard thresholded gradient updates to the amplitude-based objective function (3).",
        "As Fourier models are the ultimate goal, results towards lowering this sample complexity in the Gaussian measurement regime must be made or new modes of regularization must be explored in order for phase retrieval to advance.",
        "They show that compared to current approaches, this neural network based method requires less measurements to succeed and is computationally more efficient, needing only one hologram to reconstruct the necessary images.",
        "While our main result illustrates that the objective function exhibits favorable geometry for optimization, it does not guarantee recovery of the signal as gradient descent algorithms could, in principle, converge to the negative multiple of our true solution.",
        "The result will be shown by proving the sufficiency of two deterministic conditions on the weights W of our generative network and the measurement matrix A.",
        "The second condition is similar in the sense that it quantifies whether the measurement matrix behaves like a Gaussian when acting on the difference of pairs of vectors given by the output of the generative model.",
        "By the WDC and RRCP, we have that the descent direction vx,x0 concentrates uniformly for all non-zero x, x0 2 Rk around a particular vector vx,x0 defined by equation (5) in the Appendix.",
        "We compared our results with the sparse truncated amplitude flow algorithm (SPARTA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] and three popular general phase retrieval methods: Fienup [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], Gerchberg Saxton [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], and Wirtinger Flow [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
        "We use a modified version of Algorithm 1 in these image experiments: we ran two sessions of gradient descent for a random initial iterate x1 and its negation x1 and chose the most successful reconstruction.",
        "We allowed 10 random restarts for each algorithm, including the sparse and general phase retrieval methods."
