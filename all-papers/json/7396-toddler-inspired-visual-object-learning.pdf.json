        "abstract": "Real-world learning systems have practical limitations on the quality and quantity of the training datasets that they can collect and consider. How should a system go about choosing a subset of the possible training examples that still allows for learning accurate, generalizable models? To help address this question, we draw inspiration from a highly efficient practical learning system: the human child. Using head-mounted cameras, eye gaze trackers, and a model of foveated vision, we collected first-person (egocentric) images that represents a highly accurate approximation of the \"training data\" that toddlers\u2019 visual systems collect in everyday, naturalistic learning contexts. We used state-of-the-art computer vision learning models (convolutional neural networks) to help characterize the structure of these data, and found that child data produce significantly better object models than egocentric data experienced by adults in exactly the same environment. By using the CNNs as a modeling tool to investigate the properties of the child data that may enable this rapid learning, we found that child data exhibit a unique combination of quality and diversity, with not only many similar large, high-quality object views but also a greater number and diversity of rare views. This novel methodology of analyzing the visual \"training data\" used by children may not only reveal insights to improve machine learning, but also may suggest new experimental tools to better understand infant learning in developmental psychology."

        "Any learning system \u2014 human or machine \u2014 faces the challenge of building an accurate, general model of the world from a limited amount of training data.",
        "Our goal is to quantify the information contained in a training dataset \u2014 i.e., how well an agent could learn to generalize given the training data \u2014 so we trained on the images derived from the head camera videos, but validated and tested our models on the \u201cclean\u201d object dataset described in Section 3.1 and Figure 2c.",
        "As shown in Figure 3b, pairwise visual distances in parent data are rather small, indicating that object instances are similar to each other.",
        "The combination of clustering and variability creates a unique distribution in toddler data which may benefit visual object learning \u2014 a conjecture that will be tested in Section 4.3.",
        "Given the different visual properties observed in the views from toddlers and parents, we examined whether the special properties of the toddler data can be used to create better object recognition models.",
        "The present study used only visually attended objects with moment-by-moment acuity simulations, which is a much closer approximation of the visual data collected by toddler learners and allows us to look deeper into what properties of toddler data lead to better object recognition.",
        "The results in the last section suggest that there are special properties of toddler training data that can lead to better visual learning.",
        "Given that the object instances used in training were all resized to 224 \u21e5 224 pixels before being fed into the CNNs, the results here were not due to a direct size effect, but presumably because larger objects created higher-fidelity instances after being resized, and this better image quality led to better learning.",
        "As shown in Section 4.1, another visual property in toddler data that may contribute to successful object learning is the distribution of object views.",
        "Our results suggest that the data created by toddlers, which consists of a mix of both similar and dissimilar instances, is a unique combination of clustering and variability that may be optimal for object recognition.",
        "The present paper focused on quality of data to understand which fundamental properties in visual training data can lead to successful learning in visual object recognition \u2014 one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision and machine learning.",
        "Our work suggests that deep learning models may not have to rely on large quantities of training data to reach good performance, but that a smaller number of carefully-selected, highquality examples may be sufficient.",
        "While their internal information processing capabilities may not be as sophisticated as those of adults, they have high-quality training data to solve hard learning problems"
