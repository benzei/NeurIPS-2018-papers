        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of learning a Lipschitz function from binary feedback. In this problem, a learner is trying to learn a Lipschitz function f : [0, 1]d \u2192 [0, 1] over the course of T rounds. On round t, an adversary provides the learner with an input xt, the learner submits a guess yt for f (xt), and learns whether yt > f (xt) or yt \u2264 f (xt). The learner\u2019s goal is to minimize their total loss t (f (xt), yt) (for some loss function ). The problem is motivated by contextual dynamic pricing, where a firm must sell a stream of differentiated products to a collection of buyers with non-linear valuations for the items and observes only whether the item was sold or not at the posted price. For the symmetric loss (f (xt), yt) = |f (xt) \u2212 yt|, we provide an algorithm for this problem achieving total loss O(log T ) when d = 1 and O\u221a(T (d\u22121)/d) when d > 1, and show that both bounds are tight (up to a factor of log T ). For the pricing loss function (f (xt), yt) = f (xt) \u2212 yt1{yt \u2264 f (xt)} we show a regret bound of O(T d/(d+1)) and show that this bound is tight. We present improved bounds in the special case of a population of linear buyers."
