        "abstract": "Non-local methods exploiting the self-similarity of natural signals have been well studied, for example in image analysis and restoration. Existing approaches, however, rely on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) matching in a fixed feature space. The main hurdle in optimizing this feature space w. r. t. application performance is the non-differentiability of the KNN selection rule. To overcome this, we propose a continuous deterministic relaxation of KNN selection that maintains differentiability w. r. t. pairwise distances, but retains the original KNN as the limit of a temperature parameter approaching zero. To exploit our relaxation, we propose the neural nearest neighbors block (N3 block), a novel non-local processing layer that leverages the principle of self-similarity and can be used as building block in modern neural network architectures.1 We show its effectiveness for the set reasoning task of correspondence classification as well as for image restoration, including image denoising and single image super-resolution, where we outperform strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines and recent non-local models that rely on KNN selection in hand-chosen features spaces."

        "The ongoing surge of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has revolutionized many areas of machine learning and its applications by enabling unprecedented predictive accuracy.",
        "Incorporating this kind of non-local processing into neural network architectures for image restoration has only very recently been considered [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>].",
        "For the task of correspondence classification, we obtain significant improvements by augmenting a recent neural network baseline with our N3 block, showing its effectiveness on set-valued data.",
        "Our differentiable nearest neighbors selection generalizes this; our method can recover a single weighted average by setting k=1.",
        "We first detail our continuous and differentiable relaxation of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) selection rule.",
        "This will yield a deterministic and continuous relaxation of the stochastic nearest neighbors that still converges to the hard KNN selection rule in the limit case of t \u2192 0.",
        "We interleave N3 blocks with existing local processing networks to form neural nearest neighbors networks (N3Net) as shown in Fig. 2b.",
        "A baseline where we replace the N3 blocks with KNN selection (k = 7) to obtain neighbors for each patch.",
        "The task specific hand-chosen distance embedding for this baseline should intuitively yield more sensible nearest neighbors matches than when matching noisy input patches.",
        "Table 1 shows the results on the Urban100 test set (\u03c3 = 25) from which we can infer four insights: First, the KNN baselines and improve upon the plain DnCNN model, showing that allowing the network to access non-local information is beneficial.",
        "These include the classical BM3D [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which uses a hand-crafted denoising pipeline, and the state-of-the-art trainable non-local models NLNet [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] and UNLNet [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], both learning to process non-locally aggregated patches.",
        "As a crucial difference to our proposed N3Net, all of the compared non-local methods use KNN selection on a fixed feature space, not being able to learn an embedding for matching.",
        "UNLNet do not reach the accuracy of DnCNN even on Urban100, whereas our N3Net even fares better than the strongest local denoiser FFDNet. Third, the post-hoc non-local step applied by NN3D is very effective on Urban100 where self-similarity can intuitively shine.",
        "N3Net sets a new state of the art for denoising raw images, outperforming DnCNN and BM3D by a significant margin.",
        "CNNet consists of 12 blocks, each comprised of a local fully connected layer with 128 feature channels that processes each point individually, and a context normalization and batch normalization layer that pool information across the whole point set.",
        "We exemplified its benefit in the context of image denoising, SISR, and correspondence classification, where we outperform state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and non-local approaches.",
        "We expect the N3 block to benefit end-to-end trainable architectures for other input domains, such as text or other sequence-valued data"
