        "abstract": "Online learning to rank is a sequential decision-making problem where in each round the learning agent chooses a list of items and receives feedback in the form of clicks from the user. Many sample-efficient algorithms have been proposed for this problem that assume a specific click model connecting rankings and user behavior. We propose a generalized click model that encompasses many existing models, including the position-based and cascade models. Our generalization motivates a novel online learning algorithm based on topological sort, which we call TopRank. TopRank is (a) more natural than existing algorithms, (b) has stronger regret guarantees than existing algorithms with comparable generality, (c) has a more insightful proof that leaves the door open to many generalizations, and (d) outperforms existing algorithms empirically."

        "We assume a stochastic model where the probability that the user clicks on position k in round t only depends on At and is given by",
        "In previous work on online learning to rank it was assumed that v factors into v(a, k) = \u03b1(a(k))\u03c7(a, k) where \u03b1 : [L] \u2192 [0, 1] is the attractiveness function and \u03c7(a, k) is the probability that the user examines position k given ranking a.",
        "The assumption asserts that if a is an action and i is more attractive than j, exchanging the positions of i and j can only decrease the likelihood of clicking on the item in slot a\u22121(i).",
        "The relation is depicted in Fig. 2 where an arrow from j to i means that (j, i) \u2208 Gt. In round t the first three positions in the ranking will contain items from Pt1 = {1, 2, 4}, but with random order.",
        "Let It\u2217d = min Ptd be the most attractive item in Ptd. on event Ftc, it holds that It\u2217d \u2264 1 + c<d |Ptd| for all d \u2208 [Mt].",
        "By the definition of the algorithm arms i and j are not in the same block once Stij grows too large relative to Ntij, which means that c Snij \u2264 1 + 2Nnij log \u03b4 Nnij .",
        "The expected number of clicks on It\u2217d is bounded from below by those on items in a\u2217, Et\u22121 CtIt\u2217d",
        "To see this use part (a) of Lemma 1 to show that Et\u22121[Utij] \u2265 0 for i < j and Lemma 4 to show that when It\u2217d > K, neither It\u2217d nor j are not shown to the user in round t so that UtIt\u2217dj = 0.",
        "Our goal is to rerank L = 10 most attractive items with the objective of maximizing the expected number of clicks at the first K = 5 positions.",

        "In the position-based model, the regret of CascadeKL-UCB is higher than that of TopRank after 4 million steps.",
        "We observe that TopRank improves over BatchRank in both the cascade and position-based models.",
