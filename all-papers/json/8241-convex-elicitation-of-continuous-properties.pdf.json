        "abstract": "A property or statistic of a distribution is said to be elicitable if it can be expressed as the minimizer of some loss function in expectation. Recent work shows that continuous real-valued properties are elicitable if and only if they are identifiable, meaning the set of distributions with the same property value can be described by linear constraints. From a practical standpoint, one may ask for which such properties do there exist convex loss functions. In this paper, in a finite-outcome setting, we show that in fact essentially every elicitable real-valued property can be elicited by a convex loss function. Our proof is constructive, and leads to convex loss functions for new properties."

        "It is known that for continuous, nowhere-locally-constant, real-valued properties, identifiability implies elicitability.",
        "One of Osband\u2019s observations is that the level sets {p : \u0393(p) = r} of an elicitable property \u0393 must be convex [16, Proposition 2.5].",
        "If the level sets {p \u2208 P : \u0393(p) = r} are convex, \u0393 is elicitable, and has a continuous, bounded, and oriented identification function.",
        "The following proposition states that if the property can be written as a finite piecewise ratio of expectations, it is convex elicitable.",
        "For P = \u2206(Y), let \u0393 : P \u2192 R be a continuous, nowhere-locally-constant property which is identified by a bounded and oriented V : R \u00d7 Y \u2192 R.",
        "As we have established that F satisfies Conditions 1-3, Proposition 2 gives us a weight function \u03bb : R \u2192 R>0 such that for all y \u2208 Y, the map r \u2192 \u03bb(r)V (r, y) is strictly increasing on R.",
        "As V has a bounded derivative everywhere by assumption, it satisfies Condition 1, and convex elicitability follows from Theorem 2.",
        "Provided our three conditions hold, we have a positive weight function \u03bb satisfying the constraint (5), and we conclude that \u03bbf is increasing for all f \u2208 F.",
        "The second is a simple elicitable property for which the obvious identification function does not give a convex loss; we show how to convexify it.",
        "Consider the Beta family of loss functions discussed in Buja et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], which elicit the mean over outcomes Y = {0, 1}, with R = [0, 1].",
        "The set F = {V (\u00b7, y)}y\u2208Y satisfies Conditions 1\u20133, and we may use our construction to obtain a positive function \u03bb for which L(r, y) =",

        "Our results imply that essentially every continuous real-valued elicitable property over finite outcomes has a market mechanism which satisfies these axioms.",
        "If the gap in eq (5) is bounded away from zero, \u03bbf will be increasing at least as fast as some linear function for all f , meaning its integral will be strongly convex.",
