        "abstract": "A reciprocal recommendation problem is one where the goal of learning is not just to predict a user\u2019s preference towards a passive item (e.g., a book), but to recommend the targeted user on one side another user from the other side such that a mutual interest between the two exists. The problem thus is sharply different from the more traditional items-to-users recommendation, since a good match requires meeting the preferences at both sides. We initiate a rigorous theoretical investigation of the reciprocal recommendation task in a specific framework of sequential learning. We point out general limitations, formulate reasonable assumptions enabling effective learning and, under these assumptions, we design and analyze a computationally efficient algorithm that uncovers mutual likes at a pace comparable to that achieved by a clairvoyant algorithm knowing all user preferences in advance. Finally, we validate our algorithm against synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved empirical performance over simple baselines."

        "Recommendation Systems are at the core of many successful online businesses, from e-commerce, to online streaming, to computational advertising, and beyond.",
        "Based on this information, A\u2217 maximizes the number of matches uncovered during T rounds over all n2T possible selections that can be made in Steps (2B) and (2G).",
        "G, no algorithm will be able to uncover all M matches in expectation, since Steps (1B) and (1G) of our learning protocol entail that the expected number of times each user u logs into the system is equal to",
        "When M turns out to be a random bipartite graph9 the expected number of matches that any algorithm can achieve is always upper bounded by O.",
        "In order to avoid the pitfalls of M being a random bipartite graph, we need to slightly depart from our general model of Section 2, and make structural assumptions on the way matches can be generated.",
        "Because we get to see at each round the sign of two pairings (b, g ) and (g, b ), where b and g are drawn at random and b and g are selected by the matchmaker, our learning protocol is rather half-stochastic and half-active, which makes the way we gather information about matrix entries quite different from what is usually assumed in the available literature on matrix completion.",
        "The following theorem shows that when the optimal number of matches MT\u2217 is M , so is MT (SMILE) up to a constant factor, provided M and T are not too small.",
        "Corollary 1 Given any input graph ( B, G , E, \u03c3), with |B| = |G| = n, such that MT\u2217 = M w.h.p. as n grows large, with T and M satisfying T = \u03c9 n (CG + CB) + (n3 log n)/M , where CG and CB are the upper bounds on CG and CB given in Theorem 3, we have w.h.p. MT (SMILE) = \u0398(M ) .",
        "The variant I-SMILE that we implemented allows one not only to perform well on graphs with no underlying structure in the likes, but to discover matches during the exploration phase while learning the clusters.",
        "We have introduced an efficient matchmaker called SMILE , and have proven its ability to uncover matches at a speed comparable to the omniscient Matchmaker, so long as M and T are not too small (Theorem 3 and Corollary 1).",
        "We complemented our results with an initial set of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets in the online dating domain, showing encouraging evidence"
