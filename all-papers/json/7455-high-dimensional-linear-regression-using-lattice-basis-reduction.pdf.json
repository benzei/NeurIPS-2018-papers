        "abstract": "We consider a high dimensional linear regression problem where the goal is to efficiently recover an unknown vector \u03b2\u2217 from n noisy linear observations Y = X\u03b2\u2217 + W \u2208 Rn, for known X \u2208 Rn\u00d7p and unknown W \u2208 Rn. Unlike most of the literature on this model we make no sparsity assumption on \u03b2\u2217. Instead we adopt a regularization based on assuming that the underlying vectors \u03b2\u2217 have rational entries with the same denominator Q \u2208 Z>0. We call this Q-rationality assumption. We propose a new polynomial-time algorithm for this task which is based on the seminal Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm. We establish that under the Q-rationality assumption, our algorithm recovers exactly the vector \u03b2\u2217 for a large class of distributions for the iid entries of X and non-zero noise W . We prove that it is successful under small noise, even when the learner has access to only one observation (n = 1). Furthermore, we prove that in the case of the Gaussian white noise for W , n = o (p/ log p) and Q sufficiently large, our algorithm tolerates a nearly optimal information-theoretic level of the noise."
