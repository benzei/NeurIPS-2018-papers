        "abstract": "One of the most striking aspects of early visual processing in the retina is the immediate parcellation of visual information into multiple parallel pathways, formed by different retinal ganglion cell types each tiling the entire visual field. Existing theories of efficient coding have been unable to account for the functional advantages of such cell-type diversity in encoding natural scenes. Here we go beyond previous theories to analyze how a simple linear retinal encoding model with different convolutional cell types efficiently encodes naturalistic spatiotemporal movies given a fixed firing rate budget. We find that optimizing the receptive fields and cell densities of two cell types makes them match the properties of the two main cell types in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells, in terms of spatial and temporal sensitivity, cell spacing, and their relative ratio. Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types. Thus our work provides a theoretical justification, based on the efficient coding of natural movies, for the existence of the four most dominant cell types in the primate retina that together comprise 70% of all ganglion cells."

        "The time honored principle that the visual system evolved to efficiently encode the structure of our visual world opens up the tantalizing possibility that we can predict, ab initio, the functional organization of visual circuitry in terms of the statistical structure of natural scenes.",
        "We go beyond previous efficient coding theories of the retina by optimizing convolutional retinal models with multiple cell types of differing spatial densities to efficiently encode the spatiotemporal structure of natural movies, rather than the spatial structure in natural scenes.",
        "The orange, parasol-like cell type specializes to region (1) using a small number of cells at large stride with large spatial RFs, and fast temporal filters that fire sensitively at high rates.",
        "The blue, midget-like cell type specializes to region (2) using a large number of cells at small stride with small spatial RFs and slow temporal filters using low firing rates.",
        "The optimal solution assigns filter strength as a non-monotonic function of channel quality (Fig. 2A3), favoring channels of intermediate quality, eschewing extremely low quality channels that do not contribute much to encoding fidelity, while attenuating channels that are already high-quality whose amplification would yield a cost in firing rate that outweighs the improved coding fidelity.",
        "Within this aliasing constraint, spatiotemporal photoreceptor frequencies map one-to-one to ganglion cell frequencies, yielding an optimal solution given by Eq 8 with channel quality depending on spacetime power S.",
        "For the same total RMS firing rate budget we found both the optimal single (Fig. 3A) and two (Fig. 3B) cell type solutions.",
        "In Fig. 3AB we employed a budget that yielded an optimal cell-type ratio matching that of midget to parasol cells in the primate retina [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",
        "By specializing to these two tails, the two-cell type solution in Fig. 3B can achieve higher encoding fidelity at the same RMS firing rate budget compared to the single-cell type solution in Fig. 3A.",
        "We find an excellent match between theory and experiment in Fig. 3F, providing further evidence that the principle of efficient encoding of natural movies under a limited firing rate budget may be driving the functional organization of the primate retina.",
        "Consistent with the linear theory, the RF Fourier power spectra of parasol cells, both in nonlinear simulations and experiments, specialize to cover low spatial and high temporal frequencies.",
        "By training a nonlinear neural network on the same task of reconstructing natural movies with a limited firing rate budget, we again confirm the advantage of having midget and parasol cells, and we find further differentiation into ON and OFF types."
