        "abstract": "We propose a parsimonious quantile regression framework to learn the dynamic tail behaviors of financial asset returns. Our model captures well both the timevarying characteristic and the asymmetrical heavy-tail property of financial time series. It combines the merits of a popular sequential neural network model, i.e., LSTM, with a novel parametric quantile function that we construct to represent the conditional distribution of asset returns. Our model also captures individually the serial dependences of higher moments, rather than just the volatility. Across a wide range of asset classes, the out-of-sample forecasts of conditional quantiles or VaR of our model outperform the GARCH family. Further, the proposed approach does not suffer from the issue of quantile crossing, nor does it expose to the ill-posedness comparing to the parametric probability density function approach."

        "We model and predict conditional quantiles and heavy tails of financial return series in a parsimonious quantile regression framework that describes the distribution p in a parametric quantile function way.",
        "We let the quantile function of p be an HTQF and let the parameters of it be time-varying and depend on past information through a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) unit [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], which is a popular sequential neural network model and has been applied to many practical problems like video understanding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>][<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], video prediction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and video retrieval [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",

        "Our contributions are: (1) We propose a novel parametric quantile function to represent a distribution with asymmetric heavy tails, and leverage it to model the conditional distribution of financial return series.",
        "We first describe the proposed parametric quantile function, show how it is used to model the conditional distribution p of financial return series and how the dependence on past information is modelled.",
        "We assume its quantile function being an HTQF, denoted by Q(\u03c4 |\u03bct, \u03c3t, ut, vt), where \u03bct, \u03c3t, ut, vt are time-varying parameters representing the location, scale, and heavy tails of the corresponding distribution.",
        "The proposed HTQF is more intuitive and flexible to model asymmetric heavy tails than the PDFs in GARCH-type models, like the skewed generalized t-distribution in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
        "Even for the simplest one, the t-distribution, the analytical complexity of its PDF makes model estimation unfeasible if one assumes time-varying degrees of freedom, while our HTQF parameters can be set to be time-varying in the quantile regression framework.",
        "The plotting of {ut} and {vt} on the steel rebar test set is shown in Figure 3 (b), which indicates that high-frequency financial asset returns have time-varying heavy tails.",
        "In this paper, we proposed a parametric HTQF to represent the asymmetric heavy-tailed conditional distribution of financial return series.",
        "Conditional quantiles or VaR can be predicted with relatively better accuracy, and besides, the plotting of HTQF parameters shows us the dynamic tail behaviors of financial asset returns, some of which display clustering and spikes but difference between left and right tails.",
        "Our paper focuses on the tail dynamics, in the future, more advanced models that can learn more elaborate dynamics of the conditional distribution of financial time series are necessary, e.g., improving the flexibility of the HTQF or modifying the way how LSTM is used may be needed."
