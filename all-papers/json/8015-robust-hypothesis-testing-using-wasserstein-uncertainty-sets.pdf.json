        "abstract": "We develop a novel computationally efficient and general framework for robust hypothesis testing. The new framework features a new way to construct uncertainty sets under the null and the alternative distributions, which are sets centered around the empirical distribution defined via Wasserstein metric, thus our approach is data-driven and free of distributional assumptions. We develop a convex safe approximation of the minimax formulation and show that such approximation renders a nearly-optimal detector among the family of all possible tests. By exploiting the structure of the least favorable distribution, we also develop a tractable reformulation of such approximation, with complexity independent of the dimension of observation space and can be nearly sample-size-independent in general. Real-data example using human activity data demonstrated the excellent performance of the new robust detector."

        "In Section 4, exploiting the structure of the least favorable distributions yielding from Wasserstein uncertainty sets, we derive a tractable and scalable convex programming reformulation of the safe approximation based on strong duality (Theorem 3).",
        "The so-called simple hypothesis test assuming that the null and the alternative distributions are two singleton sets.",
        "\u201crobust hypothesis test\u201d are not mentioned, the formulation therein is essentially minimax robust hypothesis test, when the null and the alternative distributions are parametric with the parameters belong to certain convex sets.",
        "We consider more general classes of convex relaxations, and show that they can produce a nearly-optimal detector for the original problem and admits an exact tractable reformulation for common convex surrogate loss functions.",
        "Theorem 1 guarantees that the approximation (4) of problem (1) is nearly optimal, in the sense that whenever the hypotheses H1, H2 can be decided upon by a test T with risk less than \u03b5, there exists a detector \u03c6 with risk less than \u03c8(\u03b5).",
        "To establish Proposition 1, observe that the sets under inf and sup are: (i) both infinitely dimensional, the Wasserstein ball is not compact in the space of probability measures, and the space of all tests \u03c6 is not endowed with a linear topological structure, so there is no readily applicable tools to justify the interchange of inf and sup.",
        "Theorem 3 guarantees that the two problems has the same optimal value, because there exists a least favorable distribution supported on \u03a9, as explained below.",
        "We set \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03b8 as the sample sizes are identical, and \u03b8 is chosen such that the quantity 1 \u2212 1/2 inf\u03c6 \u03a6(\u03c6; P1\u2217, P2\u2217) in Table 1, or equivalently, the divergence between P1\u2217 and P2\u2217, is close to zero with high probability if Q1 and Q2 are bootstrapped from the data before change, where P1\u2217, P1\u2217 is the LFD yielding from (6).",
        "We propose a data-driven, distribution-free framework for robust hypothesis testing based on Wasserstein metric.",
