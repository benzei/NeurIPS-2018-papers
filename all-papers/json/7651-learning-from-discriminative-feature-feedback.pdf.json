We show that such discriminative features explanations can be provided whenever the target concept is a decision tree, or can be expressed as a particular type of multi-class DNF formula. We present an efficient online algorithm for learning from such feedback and we give tight bounds on the number of mistakes made during the learning process. These bounds depend only on the representation size of the target concept and not on the overall number of available features, which could be infinite. We also demonstrate the learning procedure experimentally."

        "Communication between humans and machine learning systems has typically been restricted to labels alone.",
        "We show that the algorithm provably converges to the correct concept, and we provide a tight mistake bound on the total number of errors it makes over the lifetime of the learning process.",
        "Earlier mistake bounds for online learning, such as those for the Perceptron and Winnow algorithms, had some dependence on the number of features.",
        "> Correct class: fish \u2013 In addition, the labeler provides a distinguishing feature between the instance being classified and the instance that the learner suggested as a similar example.",
        "Our assumptions posit that there is some representation of the domain as purely-labeled sets that can be separated by single features, and that this representation is the one used implicitly by the teacher when providing feedback to the learner.",
        "Discriminative feedback with m clusters is possible if and only if the target concept is expressible as a particular kind of multi-class disjunctive normal form formula over the features in",
        "We show that under the setting of discriminative feature feedback, there is an efficient learning algorithm that reaches the target concept \u21e4 after making at most 2 mistakes.",
        "Suppose that the algorithm of Figure 2 is used to learn a target concept c , and the teacher provides discriminative feature feedback corresponding to a representation G1, .",
        "Theorem 5 The worst-case mistake bound of the algorithm in Figure 2, assuming discriminative ( 1)( 2) 2 feature feedback with m clusters, is at least m m / .",
        "It is possible to derive a mistake bound which depends on the total number of features that the teacher uses during the interaction.",
        "PROOF: If the teacher uses at most k different features during the run of the algorithm, each conjunction in L uses at most k literals: Due to invariant (I-2), each conjunction is satisfied by at least one instance, it cannot include both a feature and its negation.",
        "The first table in the figure shows the prediction and similar example provided by the learner in each mistake round, as well as the correct label and discriminative feature provided by the labeler.",
        "We know from Section 2 that the scheme can in principle handle any concept, and noisy feedback is unlikely to derail convergence: if necessary, for instance, a noisily-labeled point can be in a cluster of its own.",
        "It is a first step, and a wide range of open problems remain"
