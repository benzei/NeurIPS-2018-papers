        "abstract": "A key task in Bayesian statistics is sampling from distributions that are only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of proportionality). However, without any assumptions, sampling (even approximately) can be #P-hard, and few works have provided \"beyond worst-case\" guarantees for such settings. For log-concave distributions, classical results going back to Bakry and diffusions mix in polynomial time. The most salient feature of log-concavity violated in practice is uni-modality: commonly, the distributions we wish to sample from are multi-modal. In the presence of multiple deep and well-separated modes, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid mixing. We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated tempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by transitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze this Markov chain for the canonical multi-modal distribution: a mixture of gaussians (of equal variance). The algorithm based on our Markov chain provably samples from distributions that are close to mixtures of gaussians, given access to the gradient of the log-pdf. For the analysis, we use a spectral decomposition theorem for graphs (Gharan and Trevisan, 2014) and a Markov chain decomposition technique (Madras and Randall, 2002).",

        "We define the simulated tempering Markov chain as follows.",
        "Note that simulated tempering is traditionally defined for discrete Markov chains, but we will use the continuous version.",
        "We can do this inductively: running the simulated tempering chain on the first l levels, we can estimate the partition function",

        "Step 2: Prove a new decomposition theorem (Theorem D.2) for bounding the spectral gap of the simulated tempering chain we define.",
        "We decompose the Markov chain itself; this includes a decomposition of the stationary distribution into components.",
        "(More precisely, we show a decomposition theorem on the generator of the tempering chain.) We would like to do this because in our setting, the stationary distribution is exactly a mixture distribution (Problem 1.1).",
        "The decomposition theorem is the reason why we use a slightly different simulated tempering chain, which is allowed to transition at arbitrary times, with some rate",
        "The component chains mix rapidly: this follows from the classic fact that Langevin diffusion mixes rapidly for log-concave distributions.",
        "2. The projected chain mixes rapidly: The \u201cprojected\u201d chain is defined as having more probability flow between mixture components in the same or adjacent temperatures which are close together in",
        "For gaussians with different variance, the Markov chain can fail to mix between components at the highest temperature.",
        "When we have all the estimates, we can run the simulated tempering chain on all the temperatures to get the desired sample.",
        "We initiated a study of sampling \u201cbeyond log-convexity.\" In so doing, we developed a new general technique to analyze simulated tempering, a classical algorithm used in practice to combat multimodality but that has seen little theoretical analysis.",
        "We have analyzed simulated tempering with Langevin diffusion, but note that it can be applied to any with any other Markov chain with a notion of temperature.",
        "Another interesting direction is to study other temperature heuristics used in practice, such as particle filters [Sch12, DMHW+12, PJT15, GDM+17], annealed importance sampling [Nea01], and parallel tempering [WSH09]"
