        "abstract": "Recent milestones in equilibrium computation, such as the success of Libratus, show that it is possible to compute strong solutions to two-player zero-sum games in theory and practice. This is not the case for games with more than two players, which remain one of the main open challenges in computational game theory. This paper focuses on zero-sum games where a team of players faces an opponent, as is the case, for example, in Bridge, collusion in poker, and many non-recreational applications such as war, where the colluders do not have time or means of communicating during battle, collusion in bidding, where communication during the auction is illegal, and coordinated swindling in public. The possibility for the team members to communicate before game play\u2014that is, coordinate their strategies ex ante\u2014makes the use of behavioral strategies unsatisfactory. The reasons for this are closely related to the fact that the team can be represented as a single player with imperfect recall. We propose a new game representation, the realization form, that generalizes the sequence form but can also be applied to imperfect-recall games. Then, we use it to derive an auxiliary game that is equivalent to the original one. It provides a sound way to map the problem of finding an optimal ex-antecoordinated strategy for the team to the well-understood Nash equilibrium-finding problem in a (larger) two-player zero-sum perfect-recall game. By reasoning over the auxiliary game, we devise an anytime algorithm, fictitious team-play, that is guaranteed to converge to an optimal coordinated strategy for the team against an optimal opponent, and that is dramatically faster than the prior state-of-the-art algorithm for this problem."

        "Computational studies on imperfect-information games have largely focused on twoplayer zero-sum games.",
        "The only known algorithm is based on a hybrid representation of the game, where team members play joint normal-form actions while the adversary employs sequence-form strategies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
        "This meta-player typically has imperfect recall, given that the team members observe difference aspects of the play and cannot communicate during the game.",
        "In general there exists no behavioral strategy for the team player that is realization-equivalent to the normal-form strategy induced by the coordination device, as the following example further illustrates.",
        "To illustrate the realization-form construction, we consider two three-player zero-sum extensiveform games with perfect recall, where a team composed of two players playing against the third player.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we focus on three-player zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall, and we will model the interaction of a team composed of two players playing against the third player.",
        "This representation enables the team to express any probability distribution over the ensuing subtrees, and leads to an equivalence between the behavioral strategies in this new perfect-recall game and the normal-form strategies of the original two-player imperfect-recall game between the team and the opponent.",
        "Since \u0393\u2217 is a two-player perfect-recall zero-sum game, the fictitious play (FP) algorithm can be applied with its theoretical guarantee of converging to a NE.",
