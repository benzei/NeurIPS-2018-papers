        "abstract": "This paper focusses on the formulation of numerical integration as an inferential task. To date, research effort has largely focussed on the development of Bayesian cubature, whose distributional output provides uncertainty quantification for the integral. However, the point estimators associated to Bayesian cubature can be inaccurate and acutely sensitive to the prior when the domain is high-dimensional. To address these drawbacks we introduce Bayes\u2013Sard cubature, a probabilistic framework that combines the flexibility of Bayesian cubature with the robustness of classical cubatures which are well-established. This is achieved by considering a Gaussian process model for the integrand whose mean is a parametric regression model, with an improper prior on each regression coefficient. The features in the regression model consist of test functions which are guaranteed to be exactly integrated, with remaining degrees of freedom afforded to the non-parametric part. The asymptotic convergence of the Bayes\u2013Sard cubature method is established and the theoretical results are numerically verified. In particular, we report two orders of magnitude reduction in error compared to Bayesian cubature in the context of a high-dimensional financial integral."

        "The BSC weights wk are the unique weights for a cubature rule with the points X such that every function in \u03c0 is integrated exactly and the posterior standard deviation \u03c3X coincides with the WCE in the RKHS H(k).",
        "One of the principal advantages of using the weakly-informative informative prior, obtained as a limit of Gaussians, considered in this paper is that the worst-case error can be reinterpreted as a posterior standard deviation.",
        "This section contains three numerical experiments, which investigate the empirical performance of the BSC method and the associated uncertainty quantification that is provided.",
        "After taking the limit \u03a3\u22121 \u2192 0, that yields the BSC, we proceed to set these parameters independently, following the approach suggested in [5, Sec. 4.1], but as if the prior model were f (x) | , \u03bb \u223c GP 0, \u03bbk0((x \u2212 x )/ ) .",
        "The effect of the length-scale of the Gaussian kernel k(x, x ) = exp(\u2212(x \u2212 x )2/(2 2)) on the performance of standard BC and BSC of Sec. 2.2, with \u03c0 = \u03a0m(R) := span{x\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 Nd0, \u03b11 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03b1d \u2264 m}, where x\u03b1 = x\u03b11 1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xd\u03b1d , for different m, was investigated and the quality of the uncertainty quantification was assessed.",
        "As in Sec. 3.2, it is apparent from Fig. 3 that the BSC is less sensitive to length-scale misspecification compared to the standard BC method.",
        "We again used the Mat\u00e9rn kernel with the smoothness parameter \u03c1 = 5/2 and set its length-scale and magnitude parameters for each n as described in Sec. 3.1 The results appear in Fig. 4, where we clearly observe that a larger integral variance is assigned for more difficult integrals and that the true integral value is always contained within the 95% credible interval.",
        "We obtained polynomially exact generalisations of standard BC in Thm. 2.7 and demonstrated in Cor. 2.11 how any cubature rule, including widely-used cubature methods, can be recovered as the output of a probabilistic model.",
        "As demonstrated in Sec. 3, the Bayes\u2013Sard point estimator performance is more robust to the choice of kernel and this suggests that fast Gaussian process methods (e.g., [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]) could be used for efficient automatic selection of kernel parameters with little adverse effect on accuracy of the point estimator.",
        "This will require careful analysis that accounts for how kernel parameters are estimated, and is expected to be technically more challenging"
