        "abstract": "Symmetric determinantal point processes (DPP) are a class of probabilistic models that encode the random selection of items that have a repulsive behavior. They have attracted a lot of attention in machine learning, where returning diverse sets of items is sought for. Sampling and learning these symmetric DPP\u2019s is pretty well understood. In this work, we consider a new class of DPP\u2019s, which we call signed DPP\u2019s, where we break the symmetry and allow attractive behaviors. We set the ground for learning signed DPP\u2019s through a method of moments, by solving the so called principal assignment problem for a class of matrices K that satisfy Ki,j = \u00b1Kj,i, i \u2260 j, in polynomial time."

        "Random point processes on finite spaces are probabilistic distributions that allow to model random selections of sets of items from a finite collection.",
        "In Section 3, we propose a solution to the principal minor assignment problem for signed kernels, which yields a polynomial time learning algorithm for the kernel of a signed DPP.",
        "A Determinantal Point Process (DPP) on the finite set [N ] is a random subset Y \u2286 [N ] for which there exists a matrix K \u2208 RN\u00d7N such that the following holds: P[J \u2286 Y ] = det(KJ ), \u2200J \u2286 [N ], (1)",
        "The adjacency graph of any symmetric solution of (PMA1) can be learned by querying the principal minors of order one and two.",
        "The signs of the off diagonal entries of a symmetric solution of (PMA1) should be determined using queries of higher order principal minors, and the idea is based on the fact.",
        "As in the symmetric case, the diagonal entries of any matrix K \u2208 T are given by its principal minors of order 1.",
        "We note that unlike in the symmetric case, the signs of the off diagonal entries can no longer be determined using a cycle basis of induced cycles, since such a basis may contain only cycles which have no contribution to the principal minors of K.",
        "In that case, it is necessary to query principal minors that do not correspond to induced cycles in order to find a solution to (PMA1).",
        "By solving the PMA problem, we have characterized identification of the kernel in the dense case (Theorem 2) and we have given an algorithm that finds a dense matrix H \u2208 T with prescribed principal minors, in polynomial time in the size N of the unknown matrix.",
        "As long as the adjacency graph can be recovered exactly from the samples, which would be granted with high probability for a large number of observations, and if all entries of H are bounded away from zero by some known constant, solving the PMA problem amounts in finding the signs of the entries of H, up to identifiability, which can be done exactly with high probability, if the number of observed samples is large.",
        "Extending classical symmetric DPP\u2019s to non symmetric kernels poses some questions: We do not know how to sample a signed DPP efficiently, since the strongly Rayleigh property is no longer valid and the role of the eigenvalues of the kernel is not clear, even though Lemma 1 in the Supplementary Material, for instance, shows that they still determine the distribution of the size of the DPP."
