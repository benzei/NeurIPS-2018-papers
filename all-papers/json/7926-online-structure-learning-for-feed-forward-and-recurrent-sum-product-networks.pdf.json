        "abstract": "Sum-product networks have recently emerged as an attractive representation due to their dual view as a special type of deep neural network with clear semantics and a special type of probabilistic graphical model for which marginal inference is always tractable. These properties follow from the conditions of completeness and decomposability, which must be respected by the structure of the network. As a result, it is not easy to specify a valid sum-product network by hand and therefore structure learning techniques are typically used in practice. This paper describes a new online structure learning technique for feed-forward and recurrent SPNs. The algorithm is demonstrated on real-world datasets with continuous features and sequence datasets of varying length for which the best network architecture is not obvious."

        "Poon and Domingos presented SPNs as a new type of deep architecture consisting of a rooted acyclic directed graph with interior nodes that are sums and products while the leaves are tractable distributions, including Bernoulli distributions for discrete SPNs and Gaussian distributions for continuous SPNs.",
        "Since SPNs are generative probabilistic models where the sum nodes can be interpreted as hidden variables that induce a mixture, the parameters can be estimated by the Expectation Maximization schema (EM) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
        "We assume that the variables are independent, and the algorithm will update this probability distribution as new data points are processed.",
        "Given a mini-batch of data points, the algorithm passes the points through the network from the root to the leaf nodes and updates each node along the way.",
        "When a product node is created using traditional structure learning, all variables in the scope are assumed independent.",
        "As new data points arrive at a product node, the covariance matrix is updated, and if the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables are above a certain threshold, the algorithm updates the structure so that the two variables become correlated in the model.",
        "We unroll the recurrent SPN by creating as many copies of the template network as needed to match the length of a data sequence.",
        "When a significant correlation is detected between the variables in the scope of two different children of a product node, a mixture is introduced as depicted in the right part of Fig. 1.",
        "ILSPN ran out of memory for 3 problems where it generated networks of more than 7.5 Gb. It underperformed oSLRAU on two other problems since it never modifies its product nodes after creation and its online clustering technique is not suitable for streaming data as it requires fairly large batch sizes to create new clusters.",
        "We used a number of nodes per layer that yields approximately the same number of parameters as the SPNs. Training was done by stochastic gradient descent in TensorFlow with a step size of 0.01 and mini-batch sizes that vary from 100 to 1500 depending on the size of the dataset.",
        "The results presented in Table 1 highlight the importance of an online learning technique such as oSLRAU to obtain a suitable network structure with streaming data in the absence of domain knowledge.",
        "This paper describes a new online structure learning technique for feed-forward and recurrent SPNs. oSLRAU can learn the structure of SPNs in domains for which it is unclear what might be a good structure, including sequence datasets of varying length.",
        "Discriminative learning is essential to attain good accuracy in classification"
