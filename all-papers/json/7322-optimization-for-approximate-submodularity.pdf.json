        "abstract": "We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function when given access to its approximate version. Submodular functions are heavily studied in a wide variety of disciplines since they are used to model many real world phenomena and are amenable to optimization. There are many cases however in which the phenomena we observe is only approximately submodular and the optimization guarantees cease to hold. In this paper we describe a technique that yields strong guarantees for maximization of monotone submodular functions from approximate surrogates under cardinality and intersection of matroid constraints. In particular, we show tight guarantees for maximization under a cardinality constraint and 1/(1 + P ) approximation under intersection of P matroids."

        "For distributions bounded in [1 \u270f/k, 1 + \u270f/k] the function is sufficiently close to submodular for the approximation guarantees of the greedy algorithm to go through [HS, LCSZ17, QSY+17].",

        "The algorithm does not choose x but rather the bundle at Hamming distance one from x whose addition to the current solution maximizes the approximate submodular value f.",
        "For general matroid constraints we apply the sampled-mean technique and obtain an approximation comparable to that of applying the greedy algorithm on a monotone submodular function.",

        "Since at least half of the bundles in the ball are good and at most half are bad, the above claim implies that with probability 1 3/ log n the maximal value of noise multipliers of goodpand bad bundles fall within the range [\u21e0inf , \u21e0sup].",
        "Since Lemma 3.3 applies for any fixed > 0 we know that for sufficiently large n we can lower bound the value of the maximal good bundle in the ball:",
        "In Appendix D we show nearly matching lower bounds, and in particular that no randomized algorithm can obtain an approximation ratio better than 1/2 + o(1)pwhen k = 1, and that it is impossible to obtain an approximation better than (2k 1)/2k + O(1/ n) for the optimal set of size k."
