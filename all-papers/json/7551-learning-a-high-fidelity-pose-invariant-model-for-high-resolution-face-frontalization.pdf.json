        "abstract": "Face frontalization refers to the process of synthesizing the frontal view of a face from a given profile. Due to self-occlusion and appearance distortion in the wild, it is extremely challenging to recover faithful results and preserve texture details in a high-resolution. This paper proposes a High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) to produce photographic and identity-preserving results. HF-PIM frontalizes the profiles through a novel texture warping procedure and leverages a dense correspondence field to bind the 2D and 3D surface spaces. We decompose the prerequisite of warping into dense correspondence field estimation and facial texture map recovering, which are both well addressed by deep networks. Different from those reconstruction methods relying on 3D data, we also propose Adversarial Residual Dictionary Learning (ARDL) to supervise facial texture map recovering with only monocular images. Exhaustive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate that the proposed method not only boosts the performance of pose-invariant face recognition but also dramatically improves high-resolution frontalization appearances."

        "Face frontalization refers to predicting the frontal view image from a given profile.",
        "A novel High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) is proposed to produce more realistic and identity-preserving frontalized face images with a higher resolution.",
        "Through dense correspondence field estimation and facial texture map recovering, our warping procedure can frontalize profile images with large poses and preserves abundant latent 3D shape information.",
        "To obtain the ground truth dense correspondence field F of monocular frontal face images for training, we employ face reconstruction method for 3D shape estimation.",
        "We combine dictionary representation with adversarial learning, i.e., propose ARDL based on such an observation: when the identity label is fixed, for X across different poses, the recovered texture map T should be invariant.",
        "E.g., VGG-Face [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] or Light CNN [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], can be employed to supervise the frontalized results to be as close to the ground truth as possible in feature-level.",

        "To demonstrate the superiority of our method in both controlled and unconstrained environments and produce high-resolution face frontalization results, we conduct our experiment on four datasets: Multi-PIE [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], LFW [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], IJB-A [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], and CelebA-HQ [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
        "Note that the images selected for training in CelebA-HQ are all frontal view, and we employ the face profiling method in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] to make corresponding profiles.",
        "When testing on IJB-A which contains lots of images with large and even extreme poses, our method shows a significant improvement for face verification and recognition.",
        "Data augmentation and many other practical applications, recovering high-resolution frontal view with detailed texture information has great potential for making progress.",
        "This paper has proposed High Fidelity Pose Invariant Model (HF-PIM) to produce realistic and identity-preserving frontalization results with a higher resolution.",
        "HF-PIM combines the advantages of 3D and GAN based methods and frontalizes profile images via a novel texture warping procedure.",
        "We have introduced Adversarial Residual Dictionary Learning (ARDL) to supervise facial texture map recovering without the need of 3D data.",
        "Exhaustive experiments have shown proposed method can preserve more identity information as well as texture details, which make the high-resolution results far more realistic."
