        "abstract": "Prior work has investigated variations of prediction markets that preserve participants\u2019 (differential) privacy, which formed the basis of useful mechanisms for purchasing data for machine learning objectives. Such markets required potentially unlimited financial subsidy, however, making them impractical. In this work, we design an adaptively-growing prediction market with a bounded financial subsidy, while achieving privacy, incentives to produce accurate predictions, and precision in the sense that market prices are not heavily impacted by the added privacy-preserving noise. We briefly discuss how our mechanism can extend to the data-purchasing setting, and its relationship to traditional learning algorithms."

        "When each arriving participant pays a transaction fee c = \u03b1, the private market with any \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb\u2217 from eq (1) satisfies -differential privacy, (\u03b1, \u03b3)-precision, 2\u03b1-incentive to trade, and budget bound",
        "W C(\u03bb, T ) := W C0(\u03bb, T ) + N T L(\u03bb, T ) \u2212 T c , where W C0(\u03bb, T ) is the worst-case loss of a standard prediction market maker with parameter \u03bb and T participants, N T L(\u03bb, T ) is the worst-case noise trader loss, and T c is the revenue from T transaction fees of size c each.",
        "It does not seem possible to address this via a larger transaction fee without giving up incentive to participate: traders participate as long as their expected profit exceeds the fee, and collectively \u03a9(1/\u03bb) of them can arrive making consistent trades all moving the prices in the same direction, so the total payout will still be \u03a9(1/\u03bb).",

        "A classical prediction market with budget bound B1, trades of size 1, and a small transaction fee \u03b1, will still have an \u03b1-incentive to participate, and the worst case loss will still be \u0398(B1); this loss, can be extracted by as few as \u0398(1) participants.",
        "Any additional participants must be in a sense disagreeing about the correct prices; their transaction fees go toward market maker profit, but they do not contribute further to worst-case loss.",
        "This yields a mechanism for purchasing data for machine learning that satisfies -differential privacy, \u03b1-precision and incentive to participate, and bounded designer budget.",
        "For any choices of accuracy parameters \u03b1, \u03b3, privacy parameters , \u03b4, trade size \u2206, and query limit Q, the kernel adaptive market satisfies ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy, (\u03b1, \u03b3)-precision, 2\u03b1-incentive to participate, and a bounded designer budget.",
        "Motivated by the problem of purchasing data, we gave the first bounded-budget prediction market mechanism that achieves privacy, incentive alignment, and precision.",
