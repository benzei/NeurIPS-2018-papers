        "abstract": "We consider the task of recovering two real or complex m-vectors from phaseless Fourier measurements of their circular convolution. Our method is a novel convex relaxation that is based on a lifted matrix recovery formulation that allows a nontrivial convex relaxation of the bilinear measurements from convolution. We prove that if the two signals belong to known random subspaces of dimensions k and n, then they can be recovered up to the inherent scaling ambiguity with m >> (k + n) log2 m phaseless measurements. Our method provides the first theoretical recovery guarantee for this problem by a computationally efficient algorithm and does not require a solution estimate to be computed for initialization. Our proof is based Rademacher complexity estimates. Additionally, we provide an ADMM implementation of the method and provide numerical experiments that verify the theory."

        "This paper considers recovery of two unknown signals from the magnitude only measurements of their convolution.",
        "We show that this non-linear problem can be efficiently solved, under Gaussian measurements, using a semidefinite program and theoretically prove this assertion.",

        "The resulting rank-1 matrix is recovered using nuclear norm as a convex relaxation of the non-convex rank constraint.",
        "Since the circular convolution operator diagonalizes in the Fourier domain, the measurements in (1) take the following form after incorporating the subspace constraints in (2)",
        "We study the combination of two important and notoriously challenging signal recovery problems: phase retrieval and blind deconvolution.",
        "The strengths of our approach are that it allows a novel convex program that is the first to provably permit recovery guarantees with optimal sample complexity for the joint task of phase retrieval and blind deconvolution when the signals belong to known random subspaces.",
        "As with the initial recovery theory for the problems of compressed sensing and phase retrieval, we have studied the random case in order to show information theoretically optimal sample complexity is possible by efficient algorithms.",
        "It is clear that blind deconvolutional phase retrieval is still a very challenging problem in the presence of deterministic matrices, and one for which development of convex or nonconvex methods may provide substantial progress in applications.",
        "To prove Theorem 1, we will show that (H , M ) is the unique minimizer of an optimization program with a larger feasible set defined by linear constraints.",
        "The geometry of the linearly constrained program (9) is shown in Figure 1 (Right), where the hyperbolic set is replaced by an envelop of hyperplanes defined by the linear constraints of (9).",
        "We begin by characterizing the set of descent directions for the objective function of the optimization program (9).",
        "We quantify the \"width\" of the set of descent directions Q through a Rademacher complexity, and a probability that the gradients of the constraint functions of (9) lie in a certain half space.",
