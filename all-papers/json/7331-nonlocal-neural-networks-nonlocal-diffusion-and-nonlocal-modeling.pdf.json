In this paper, we study the nature of diffusion and damping effect of nonlocal networks by doing spectrum analysis on the weight matrices of the well-trained networks, and then propose a new formulation of the nonlocal block. The new block not only learns the nonlocal interactions but also has stable dynamics, thus allowing deeper nonlocal structures. Moreover, we interpret our formulation from the general nonlocal modeling perspective, where we make connections between the proposed nonlocal network and other nonlocal models, such as nonlocal diffusion process and Markov jump process."

    "summary": [
        "Nonlocal neural networks are usually employed and incorporated into existing cutting-edge model architectures, such as the residual network (ResNet) and its variants, so that one can take full advantage of nonlocal blocks in capturing long-range features.",
        "Figure 1 shows the top 32 eigenvalues of the symmetric part of weight matrices after training when adding 1, 2 and 3 nonlocal blocks to PreResNet-20.",
        "For the 4-block case, we obtain many positive eigenvalues of the symmetrized weight matrices after training.",
        "For the original nonlocal network, since the damping effect cannot be preserved when adding more nonlocal blocks, the training becomes more difficult and the validation performs worse.",
        "Figure 4 shows the top 32 eigenvalues of the symmetric part of weight matrices after training when adding 4 new nonlocal blocks to PreResNet-20, where we can see that most of the eigenvalues are positive.",
        "A potential reason is that all the nonlocal blocks in a stage share the same affinity function, which is pre-computed given the input features.",
        "In this case the two kinds of nonlocal blocks have the same affinity kernel, the proposed nonlocal network still performs better than the original one, which implies that the proposed nonlocal blocks are more suitably defined with respect to the nature of diffusion.",
        "We study the relationship between the proposed nonlocal network and a couple of existing nonlocal models, i.e., the nonlocal diffusion systems and Markov chain with jump processes.",
        "In the embedded Gaussian and dot product cases, we can instead embed the input features by some weight matrix as the parameter and feed the pre-embedded features into the nonlocal stage and use the traditional Gaussian or dot product function as the affinity, namely, we replace the kernel by \u03c9\u03b8(Xi, Xj) = \u03c9 \u03b8(Xi), \u03b8(Xj) , (13)",
        "The stability property of the proposed nonlocal network is important, because it ensures that we can stack multiple nonlocal blocks within a single stage to fully exploit their advantages in capturing long-range features.",
        "The proposed nonlocal network in Eq (8) shares some common features with the discrete-time Markov chain with jump processes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
        "Our proposed nonlocal network with negative weight matrices can be regraded as the reverse Markov jump process.",
        "While one can still learn long-range features in the network, stacking several original blocks will cast uncertainty to the model and requires extra work to study the initialization strategy or to fine-tune the parameters.",
        "We studied the damping effect of the existing nonlocal networks in the literature by performing the spectrum analysis on the weight matrices of the well-trained networks.",
        "We aim to investigate the proposed nonlocal network on other challenging real-world learning tasks"
