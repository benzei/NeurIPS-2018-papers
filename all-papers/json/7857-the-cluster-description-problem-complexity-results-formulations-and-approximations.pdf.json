        "abstract": "Consider the situation where you are given an existing k-way clustering \u03c0. A challenge for explainable AI is to find a compact and distinct explanation of each cluster which in this paper is assumed to use instance-level descriptors/tags from a common dictionary. Since the descriptors/tags were not given to the clustering method, this is not a semi-supervised learning situation. We show that the feasibility problem of testing whether any distinct description (not necessarily the most compact) exists is generally intractable for just two clusters. This means that unless P = NP, there cannot exist an efficient algorithm for the cluster description problem. Hence, we explore ILP formulations for smaller problems and a relaxed but restricted setting that leads to a polynomial time algorithm for larger problems. We explore several extensions to the basic setting such as the ability to ignore some instances and composition constraints on the descriptions of the clusters. We show our formulation\u2019s usefulness on Twitter data where the communities were found using social connectivity (i.e. follower relation) but the explanation of the communities is based on behavioral properties of the nodes (i.e. hashtag usage) not available to the clustering method."

        "There are many clustering algorithms which perform well towards their aim of finding cohesive groups of instances.",
        "We formulate an ILP version of the problem in Section 4 and observe that the number of variables and constraints is linear with respect to the number of instances, tags and clusters.",
        "For larger problems in Section 5 we explore an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 relaxation for which a polynomial time algorithm exists where each cluster\u2019s description has at most \u03b1 tags and no two cluster descriptions can have more than \u03b2 tags in common.",
        "(3) Our basic ILP formulation models complex forms of set cover involving multiple universes and extended formulations explore ignoring instances and composition constraints on the tags.",
        "Later in Section 4 we will cover the Disjoint Tag Descriptor Minimization (DTDM) problem which adds the requirement that the size of the description is minimized, that is: (c) j |Tj| is minimized.",
        "Theorem 3.1 The DTDF problem is NP-complete even when the number of clusters is 2 and the tag set of each item is of size at most 3.",
        "Our basic constraint requires that the tags chosen to represent each cluster do not overlap that is they must be disjoint or minimally overlap, where wj is the maximum number of times tag j can be used in descriptors.",
        "To require two tags to always be used to describe the same cluster or two tags to never describe the same cluster we introduce two sets of pairs, namely Together and Apart, which are not unlike the must-link and cannot-link constraints used in constrained clustering [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] though the complexity results are different.",
        "As shown in Section 3, one of the reasons for the computational intractability of the DTDF problem is the requirement that the cluster descriptors be pairwise disjoint.",
        "We first show that the (\u03b1, \u03b2)-CONS-DESC problem can be solved in polynomial time when, in addition to \u03b1 and \u03b2, the number k of clusters is fixed.",
        "Theorem 5.1 The (\u03b1, \u03b2)-CONS-DESC problem can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters k is fixed.",
        "Our result shows that when the number of clusters k is not fixed, the (\u03b1, \u03b2)-CONS-DESC problem remains NP-complete.",
        "From these experiments we can conclude the ILP formulations are useful for problems of tens of thousands of instances and hundreds of tags.",
        "The cluster description problem allows taking an existing clustering obtained from one data set and explaining it with another."
