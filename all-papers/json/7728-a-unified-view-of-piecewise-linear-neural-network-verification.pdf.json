        "abstract": "The success of Deep Learning and its potential use in many safety-critical applications has motivated research on formal verification of Neural Network (NN) models. Despite the reputation of learned NN models to behave as black boxes and the theoretical hardness of proving their properties, researchers have been successful in verifying some classes of models by exploiting their piecewise linear structure and taking insights from formal methods such as Satisifiability Modulo Theory. These methods are however still far from scaling to realistic neural networks. To facilitate progress on this crucial area, we make two key contributions. First, we present a unified framework that encompasses previous methods. This analysis results in the identification of new methods that combine the strengths of multiple existing approaches, accomplishing a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state of the art. Second, we propose a new data set of benchmarks which includes a collection of previously released testcases. We use the benchmark to provide the first experimental comparison of existing algorithms and identify the factors impacting the hardness of verification problems."

        "Despite their success in a wide variety of applications, Deep Neural Networks have seen limited adoption in safety-critical settings.",
        "Katz et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] present a procedure named Reluplex to verify properties of Neural Network containing linear functions and ReLU activation unit, functioning as an SMT solver using the splitting-on-demand framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
        "The problem will be split completely over all possible combinations of activation patterns, at which point the sub-problems will all be simple LPs. This algorithm can be mapped to the special case of branch-and-bound for satisfiability.",
        "The branching rule is implemented by the ReLU-splitting procedure: when neither the upper bound search, nor the detection of infeasibility are successful, one non-linear constraint over the j-th neuron of the i-th layer xi[j] = max xi[j], 0 is split out into two subdomains: {xi[j] = 0, xi[j] \u2264 0} and {xi[j] = xi[j], xi[j] \u2265 0}.",
        "In order to detect incoherent assignments, Ehlers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] introduces a global linear approximation to a neural network, which is used as a bounding method to over-approximate the set of values that each hidden unit can take.",
        "To use this approximation to compute better bounds than the ones given by simple interval arithmetic, it is possible to leverage the feed-forward structure of the neural networks and obtain bounds one layer at a time.",
        "In addition to the pruning obtained by the convex relaxation, both Planet and Reluplex make use of conflict analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] to discover combinations of splits that cannot lead to satisfiable assignments, allowing them to perform further pruning of the domains.",
        "It could be argued that since the function encoded by the neural networks are piecewise linear in their input, this could result in the computation of highly useful upper and lower bounds.",
        "One of the main advantage of branching over the variables is that all subdomains generated by the BaB algorithm when splitting over the input variables end up only having simple bound constraints over the value that input variable can take.",
        "While methods such as Reluplex, Planet or the MIP encoding depends on the piecewise linearity, any type of networks for which an appropriate bounding function can be found will be verifiable using branch-and-bound.",
        "Existing data sets do not allow us to explore the impact on the performance of different methods of various problem/model parameters such as depth, number of hidden units, and input dimensionality.",
        "Note that we are able to use the fast methods of Kolter & Wong [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] for the smart branching because branching over the inputs makes the bounding problem similar to the one solved in robust optimization.",
        "Its continued analysis should reveal even more efficient algorithms in the future"
