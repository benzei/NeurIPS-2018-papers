[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] has achieved state-of-the-art results for learning spherical images in a rotation invariant way by using ideas from group representation theory and noncommutative harmonic analysis. In this paper we propose a generalization of this work that generally exhibits improved performace, but from an implementation point of view is actually simpler. An unusual feature of the proposed architecture is that it uses the Clebsch\u2013Gordan transform as its only source of nonlinearity, thus avoiding repeated forward and backward Fourier transforms. The underlying ideas of the paper generalize to constructing neural networks that are invariant to the action of other compact groups."

    "summary": [
        "Despite the many recent breakthroughs in deep learning, we still do not have a satisfactory understanding of how deep neural networks are able to achieve such spectacular perfomance on a wide range of learning problems.",
        "One potential drawback of Spherical CNNs of the form proposed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], is that the nonlinear transform in each layer still needs to be computed in \u201creal space\u201d.",
        "Spherical CNNs are not the only context in which the idea of Fourier space neural networks has recently appeared [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
        "While retaining the connection to noncommutative Fourier analysis, we relax the requirement that the activation of each layer of the network needs to be a function on SO(3), requiring only that it be expressible as a collection of some number of SO(3)\u2013covariant vectors corresponding to different irreducible representations of the group.",
        "2. Rather than a pointwise nonlinearity in real space, our network takes the tensor (Kronecker) product of the activations in each layer followed by decomposing the result into irreducible fragments using the so-called Clebsch\u2013Gordan decomposition.",
        "Noncommutative harmonic analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] tells us that functions on the rotation group admit a type of generalized Fourier transform.",
        "The starting point for our Generalized Spherical CNNs is the Fourier space correlation formula (10).",
        "We use the term \u201ccovariant\u201d if the actions are qualitively different, as in the case of rotations of functions on the sphere and the corresonding transformations (15) of the irreducible fragments in a neural network.",
        "What the (16) lacks in interpretability it makes up for in terms of generality, since it provides an extremely simple and flexible way of inducing SO(3)\u2013covariant linear transformations in neural networks.",
        "Whereas in conventional neural networks the linear transformation always precedes the nonlinear operation, in Clebsch\u2013Gordan networks it is natural to design each layer so as to perform the CG-transform first, and the convolution like step (16), which will limit the number of fragments.",
        "Note that in contrast to other architectures such as [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] that involve repeated forward and backward transforms, thanks to their fully Fourier nature, for Clebsch\u2013Gordan nets, in both training and testing, the elements of F0S are guaranteed to be invariant to rotations of arbitrary magnitude not just approximately, but in the exact sense, up to limitations of finite precision arithmetic.",
        "We have presented an SO(3)-equivariant neural network architecture for spherical data that operates completely in Fourier space, circumventing a major drawback of earlier models that need to switch back and forth between Fourier space and \u201creal\u201d space.",
        "While the specific focus is on spheres and SO(3)-equivariance, the approach is more widely applicable, suggesting a general formalism for designing fully Fourier neural networks that are equivariant to the action of any compact continuous group."
