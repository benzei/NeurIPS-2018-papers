        "abstract": "Metric learning, aiming to learn a discriminative Mahalanobis distance matrix M that can effectively reflect the similarity between data samples, has been widely studied in various image recognition problems. Most of the existing metric learning methods input the features extracted directly from the original data in the preprocess phase. What\u2019s worse, these features usually take no consideration of the local geometrical structure of the data and the noise that exists in the data, thus they may not be optimal for the subsequent metric learning task. In this paper, we integrate both feature extraction and metric learning into one joint optimization framework and propose a new bilevel distance metric learning model. Specifically, the lower level characterizes the intrinsic data structure using graph regularized sparse coefficients, while the upper level forces the data samples from the same class to be close to each other and pushes those from different classes far away. In addition, leveraging the KKT conditions and the alternating direction method (ADM), we derive an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model. Extensive experiments on various occluded datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

        "Metric learning problem is concerned with learning an optimal distance matrix M that captures the important relationships among data for a given task, i.e., assigning smaller distances between similar items and larger distances between dissimilar items.",
        "We propose to extract features and learn the Mahalanobis distance matrix M through a unified joint optimization model.",
        "We integrate the graph regularized sparse coding model into the distance metric learning framework and propose our new bilevel model.",
        "Large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], as one of the most widely used metric learning methods, requires the learned Mahalanobis distance to satisfy two objectives, i.e., samples from the same class are forced to be close to each other and those from different classes are pushed far away.",
        "In this paper, we propose a bilevel model which jointly learns the distance matrix M and extracts features under a sparse representation-based framework.",
        "The proposed bilevel distance metric learning model (3) is reformulated to a unilevel optimization problem which can be solved by ADM.",
        "There are two main goals in our experiments: first, we will show that our bilevel model is more robust to be applied to solve real-world occlusion problems; second, our model is able to outperform the related metric learning methods.",
        "We compare the proposed bilevel distance metric learning model with the following methods: the base-line KNN [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], LMNN [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], FANTOPE [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], CAP [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and RML [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
        "LMNN is one of the most widely-used Mahalanobis distance metric learning methods, which uses labeled information to generate triplet constraints.",
        "Same as FANTOPE method, CAP method is based on LMNN, and it uses a capped trace norm to penalize the singular values of distance matrix M that are less than a threshold adaptively learned in the optimization.",
        "This is because the proposed model jointly extracts features under a sparse-representation model and performs distance metric learning task at the same time.",
        "Since we use the sparsity penalty and graph regularization in the lower level model, the new features is not only more robust to noise but discriminative.",
        "We propose a new bilevel distance metric learning model for robust image recognition task.",
        "Different from conventional metric learning methods which learn a Mahalanobis distance matrix based on extracted features, we dig the intrinsic data structures using the Laplacian graph regularized sparse coefficients and jointly perform distance metric learning at the same time.",
        "Due to the feature extraction operation of the lower level model, the new descriptors become more robust to noise with the sparsity norm and more discriminative with the Laplacian graph term, leading to good recognition performance.",
        "Extensive experiments on several occluded datasets verify the remarkable performance improvements led by the proposed bilevel model"
