        "abstract": "Electronic health records provide a rich source of data for machine learning methods to learn dynamic treatment responses over time. However, any direct estimation is hampered by the presence of time-dependent confounding, where actions taken are dependent on time-varying variables related to the outcome of interest. Drawing inspiration from marginal structural models, a class of methods in epidemiology which use propensity weighting to adjust for time-dependent confounders, we introduce the Recurrent Marginal Structural Network - a sequence-to-sequence architecture for forecasting a patient\u2019s expected response to a series of planned treatments. Using simulations of a state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model of tumor growth [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], we demonstrate the ability of our network to accurately learn unbiased treatment responses from observational data \u2013 even under changes in the policy of treatment assignments \u2013 and performance gains over benchmarks."

        "To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning method for time-dependent effects and establishes a framework to use existing RNN architectures for treatment response estimation.",
        "We use two sets of deep neural networks to build a Recurrent Marginal Structural Network (R-MSN) - 1) a set propensity networks to compute treatment probabilities used for IPTW, and 2) a prediction network used to determine the treatment response for a given set of planned interventions.",
        "One key difference between our model and standard sequence-to-sequence (e.g.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]) is that the last unit of the encoder is used in making predictions for the first time step, in addition to the decoder units at further horizons.",
        "Encoder The goal of the encoder is to learn good representations for the patient\u2019s current clinical state, and we do so with a standard LSTM that makes one-step-ahead predictions of the outcome (Yt+1) given observations of covariates and actual treatments.",
        "The encoder was trained to forecast standard one-step-ahead treatment response according to the structure in Figure 3(b), using all available information on treatments and covariates until the current time step.",
        "Treatment Assignment Policy To introduce time-dependent confounders, we assume that chemotherapy prescriptions Ac(t) \u2208 {0, 1} and radiotherapy prescriptions Ad(t) \u2208 {0, 1} are Bernoulli random variables, with probabilities pc(t) and pd(t) respectively that are a functions of the tumor diameter: pc(t) = \u03c3 \u03b3c Dmax",
        "We evaluate the performance of R-MSNs against MSMs and Bayesian nonparametric models, focusing on its effectiveness in estimating unbiased treatment responses and its multi-step prediction performance.",
        "Time-Dependent Confounding Adjustments To investigate how well models learn unbiased treatment responses from observational data, we trained all models on simulations with \u03b3c = \u03b3d = 10 and examine the root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of one-step-ahead predictions as \u03b3\u2217 is reduced.",
        "While the R-BTRC does show improvements over MSMs for the unbiased treatment response, we observe a slight underperformance versus MSMs on the training policy itself, highlighting the advantages of R-MSNs. This paper introduces Recurrent Marginal Structural Networks - a novel learning approach for predicting unbiased treatment responses over time, grounded in the framework of marginal structural models.",
        "Using tests on a medically realistic simulation model, the R-MSN demonstrated performance improvements over traditional methods in epidemiology and the state-ofthe-art models for joint treatment response prediction over multiple timesteps."
