        "abstract": "We present MubyNet \u2013 a feed-forward, multitask, bottom up system for the integrated localization, as well as 3d pose and shape estimation, of multiple people in monocular images. The challenge is the formal modeling of the problem that intrinsically requires discrete and continuous computation, e.g. grouping people vs. predicting 3d pose. The model identifies human body structures (joints and limbs) in images, groups them based on 2d and 3d information fused using learned scoring functions, and optimally aggregates such responses into partial or complete 3d human skeleton hypotheses under kinematic tree constraints, but without knowing in advance the number of people in the scene and their visibility relations. We design a multi-task deep neural network with differentiable stages where the person grouping problem is formulated as an integer program based on learned body part scores parameterized by both 2d and 3d information. This avoids suboptimality resulting from separate 2d and 3d reasoning, with grouping performed based on the combined representation. The final stage of 3d pose and shape prediction is based on a learned attention process where information from different human body parts is optimally integrated. State-of-the-art results are obtained in large scale datasets like Human3.6M and Panoptic, and qualitatively by reconstructing the 3d shape and pose of multiple people, under occlusion, in difficult monocular images."

        "We provide a method that leverages a volumetric 3d scene representation with learned scoring functions for the component parts, and an efficient global linear integer programming solution for person grouping with kinematic constraint generation, and amenable to efficient solvers (e.g. 30ms/image).",
        "The resulting scores are assembled in a vector c and passed to a binary integer programming module that optimally computes skeletons for multiple people under kinematic constraints.",
        "Our skeleton grouping strategy relies on detecting potential human body joints and their type in images, assembling putative limbs, scoring them using trainable functions, and solving a global, optimal assignment problem to find all connected components satisfying strong kinematic tree constraints \u2013 each component being a different person.",
        "The problem of identifying the skeletons of multiple people is posed as estimating the optimal L\u2217 \u2286 L such that graph G = (J, L\u2217) has properties (i) any connected component of G falls on a single person, \u2200p, q \u2208 L\u2217, p = (i1, j1) and q = (i2, j2) with t(i1) = t(i2) and t(j1) = t(j2): if j1 = j2 i1 = i2 and if i1 = i2 j1 = j2 \u2013 these constraints ensure that connected components select at most one joint of a given type, and the connected components are as large as possible.",
        "An immediate way of decoding the M3d volume into 3d pose estimates for all the persons in the image, is to average 3d skeleton predictions at spatial locations given by the limbs selected by the people grouping module.",
        "In order to further represent the 3d shape of each person, we use a SMPL-based human model representation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] controlled by a set of parameters \u03b8 \u2208 R72\u00d71, which encode joint angle rotations, and \u03b2 \u2208 R10\u00d71 body dimensions, respectively.",
