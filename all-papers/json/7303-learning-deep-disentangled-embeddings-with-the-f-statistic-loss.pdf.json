        "abstract": "Deep-embedding methods aim to discover representations of a domain that make explicit the domain\u2019s class structure and thereby support few-shot learning. Disentangling methods aim to make explicit compositional or factorial structure. We combine these two active but independent lines of research and propose a new paradigm suitable for both goals. We propose and evaluate a novel loss function based on the F statistic, which describes the separation of two or more distributions. By ensuring that distinct classes are well separated on a subset of embedding dimensions, we obtain embeddings that are useful for few-shot learning. By not requiring separation on all dimensions, we encourage the discovery of disentangled representations. Our embedding method matches or beats state-of-the-art, as evaluated by performance on recall@k and few-shot learning tasks. Our method also obtains performance superior to a variety of alternatives on disentangling, as evaluated by two key properties of a disentangled representation: modularity and explicitness. The goal of our work is to obtain more interpretable, manipulable, and generalizable deep representations of concepts and categories."

        "Despite their overlapping and related goals, surprisingly little effort has been made to connect research in deep embeddings and disentangling.",
        "Deep-embedding methods are trained using a class-aware oracle which can be queried to indicate whether two instances are of the same or different class.",
        "A factor-aware oracle might be used to train deep embeddings, and hopefully disentangled representations would emerge.",
        "This approach is based entirely on statistics of the training set, whereas every other deep-embedding method of which we are aware uses training criteria that are based on individual instances.",
        "In contrast to other losses, the F-statistic loss is not invariant to rotations in the embedding space; this focus on separating along specific dimensions tends to yield disentangled features when the class structure is factorial or compositional.",
        "As in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUstinova_2016_a\" href=\"#rUstinova_2016_a\">Ustinova & Lempitsky (2016</a>), embeddings obtained discovered by the histogram and binomial-deviance losses are constrained to lie on the unit hypersphere; cosine distance is used for training and evaluation.",
        "For the F -statistic loss, we determined the best value of d, the number of dimensions to separate, using the validation set of the first split.",
        "We use this quantification of modularity and explicitness to evaluate our F -statistic loss against other disentangling and deep-embedding methods.",
        "Proposed disentangling procedures lie at one of two extremes of supervision: either entirely unsupervised (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2016_a\">Chen et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHiggins_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHiggins_et+al_2017_a\">Higgins et al, 2017</a>), or requiring factor-aware oracles\u2014oracles that name a particular factor and provide sets of instances that either differ on all factors except the named factor (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKulkarni_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rKulkarni_et+al_2015_a\">Kulkarni et al, 2015</a>) or are ordered by factor-specific similarity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKaraletsos_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rKaraletsos_et+al_2015_a\">Karaletsos et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVeit_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rVeit_et+al_2016_a\">Veit et al, 2016</a>).",
        "Our unnamed-factor oracle is a generalization of the procedure used for training deep embeddings, where the oracle judges similarity of instances by class label, without reference to the specific class label.",
        "Figure 3 shows the modularity and explicitness scores for representations learned on the sprites and small NORB datasets using triplet, histogram, and F -statistic losses.",
        "It is a weaker form of supervision than the unnamed-factor oracle provides, and is analogous to the type of training performed with deep-embedding procedures, where the oracle indicates whether or not instances match on class without naming the class or its component factors.",
        "We have shown that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the recall@1 task used to evaluate deep embeddings when trained with a class-aware oracle, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in disentangling when trained with an unnamed-factor oracle."
