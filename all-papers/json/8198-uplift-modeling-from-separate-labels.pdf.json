        "abstract": "Uplift modeling is aimed at estimating the incremental impact of an action on an individual\u2019s behavior, which is useful in various application domains such as targeted marketing (advertisement campaigns) and personalized medicine (medical treatments). Conventional methods of uplift modeling require every instance to be jointly equipped with two types of labels: the taken action and its outcome. However, obtaining two labels for each instance at the same time is difficult or expensive in many real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method of uplift modeling that is applicable to a more practical setting where only one type of labels is available for each instance. We show a mean squared error bound for the proposed estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments."

        "We first show that the individual uplift is identifiable when we have two sets of separately labeled samples collected under different treatment policies.",
        "We propose a novel method that directly estimates the individual uplift only from separately labeled samples.",
        "We suppose that the following four training data sets, which we call separately labeled samples, are given:",
        "Remark on the problem setting: Uplift modeling is often referred to as individual treatment effect estimation or heterogeneous treatment effect estimation and has been extensively studied especially in the causal inference literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>].",
        "Given that treatment policies are unknown, our problem setting is of observational studies but poses an additional challenge that stems from missing labels.",
        "What makes our problem feasible is that we have two kinds of data sets following different treatment policies.",
        "We will show an important lemma that directly relates the marginal distributions of separately labeled samples to the individual uplift u(x).",
        "Let RNq (H) denote the Rademacher complexity of a set of functions H over N random variables following probability density q.",
        "Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 imply that minimizing supg\u2208G J(f, g), as the proposed method does, amounts to minimizing an upper bound of the mean squared error.",
        "For the linear-in-parameter models, it can be shown that the mean squared error of the proposed estimator is upper bounded by O(1/\u221an + 1/\u221an) plus some model mis-specification error with high probability as follows.",
        "We use the linear-in-parameter models with Gaussian basis functions centered at randomly sub-sampled training data points.",

        "The proposed method again performed better than the baseline methods with neural networks.",
        "We proposed a theoretically guaranteed and practically useful method for uplift modeling or individual treatment effect estimation under the presence of systematic missing labels.",
        "The proposed method showed promising results in our experiments on synthetic and real data sets.",
        "The proposed framework is model-independent: any models can be used to approximate the individual uplift including ones tailored for specific problems and complex models such as neural networks.",
        "Addressing this issue would be important research directions for further expanding the applicability and improving the performance of the proposed method"
