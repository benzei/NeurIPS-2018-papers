        "abstract": "In extreme classification problems, learning algorithms are required to map instances to labels from an extremely large label set. We build on a recent extreme classification framework with logarithmic time and space [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], and on a general approach for error correcting output coding (ECOC) with loss-based decoding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and introduce a flexible and efficient approach accompanied by theoretical bounds. Our framework employs output codes induced by graphs, for which we show how to perform efficient loss-based decoding to potentially improve accuracy. In addition, our framework offers a tradeoff between accuracy, model size and prediction time. We show how to find the sweet spot of this tradeoff using only the training data. Our experimental study demonstrates the validity of our assumptions and claims, and shows that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "summary": [
        "Multiclass classification is the task of assigning instances with a category or class from a finite set.",
        "In this work we build on these two works and introduce an efficient (i.e. O time and space) loss-based learning and decoding algorithm for any loss function of the binary learners\u2019 margin.",
        "Employing coding matrices induced by different trellis graphs, our method allows tradeoffs between accuracy, model size, and inference time, especially appealing for extreme classification.",
        "A recent extreme classification approach, proposed by Jasinska and Karampatziakis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], performs training and inference in time and space logarithmic in K, by embedding the K classes into K paths of a directed-acyclic trellis graph T , built compactly with = O edges.",
        "The OVR coding matrix suffers from a small minimum distance (\u03c1 = 2), but as we explained, the induced subproblems are very simple, allowing a higher classification accuracy in many cases.",
        "This is a significant advantage: while inference with loss-based decoding for general matrices requires O time, our model performs it in only O = O.",
        "For the two largest datasets (Dmoz and LSHTC1) we report significant accuracy improvement when using the exponential loss for decoding in graphs with large slice widths (b), over the squared loss used implicitly by LTLS.",
        "Our model is often better or competitive with the other algorithms that have logarithmic inference time complexity (LTLS, LOMTree, FastXML), and competitive with OVR in terms of accuracy, while we still enjoy much smaller model sizes.",
        "In Figure 6 we plot the multiclass test accuracy versus model size for the non-sparse W-LTLS, as well as the sparse W-LTLS after pruning the weights as explained above.",
        "We note that PD-Sparse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and DiSMEC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] perform better on some model size regions of the datasets, their worse case space requirement during training is linear in the number of classes K, whereas our approach guarantees logarithmic space for training.",
        "Norouzi et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] proposed a fast exact search nearest neighbor algorithm in the Hamming space, which for coding matrices suitable for extreme classification can achieve o (K) time complexity, but not O.",
        "Motivated by a general error bound for loss-based decoding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], we show how to build on the log-time log-space (LTLS) framework [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and employ a more general type of trellis graph architectures.",
        "One could try to improve the restrictively low minimum code distance of W-LTLS discussed in Section 4.2 Regularization terms could be introduced, to try and further improve the learned sparse models.",
        "Many ideas in this paper can be extended for other types of graphs and graph algorithms"
