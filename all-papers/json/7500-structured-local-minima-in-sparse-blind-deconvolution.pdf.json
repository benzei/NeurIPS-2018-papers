        "abstract": "Blind deconvolution is a ubiquitous problem of recovering two unknown signals from their convolution. Unfortunately, this is an ill-posed problem in general. This paper focuses on the short and sparse blind deconvolution problem, where the one unknown signal is short and the other one is sparsely and randomly supported. This variant captures the structure of the unknown signals in several important applications. We assume the short signal to have unit 2 norm and cast the blind deconvolution problem as a nonconvex optimization problem over the sphere. We demonstrate that (i) in a certain region of the sphere, every local optimum is close to some shift truncation of the ground truth, and (ii) for a generic short signal of length k, when the sparsity of activation signal \u03b8 k\u22122/3 and number of measurements m poly (k), a simple initialization method together with a descent algorithm which escapes strict saddle points recovers a near shift truncation of the ground truth kernel."

    "summary": [
        "The short-and-sparse blind deconvolution problem exhibits a scaled-shift ambiguity, which derives from the basic properties of a convolution operator.",
        "The presence of these local optima can be viewed as a result of the shift symmetry associated to the convolution operator: the shifted and truncated kernel \u03b9k\u2217s\u03c4 [a0] can be convolved with the sparse signal s\u2212\u03c4 [x0] to produce a near approximation to the observation \u03b9\u2217ks\u03c4 [a0] s\u2212\u03c4 [x0] \u2248 y.",
        "We demonstrate that even when x0 is relatively dense, any local minimum in certain region of the sphere is close to a shift truncation \u03b9\u2217ks\u03c4 [a0] of the ground truth.",
        "In light of the above observations, a natural computational approach to sparse blind deconvolution is to attempt to find x0 by searching for a sparse vector in the linear subspace row(X0), e.g., by solving an optimization problem min v s.",
        "5[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] proposes to solve the short-and-sparse blind deconvolution problem with a two phase algorithm which first recovers a shift truncation, and recovers the ground truth kernel with an annealing algorithm.",
        "Based on the above characterizations of stationary points in RC with C \u2265 10, we can deduce that any local minimum is close to al for some integer l, a preconditioned shift truncation of the ground truth a0.",
        "Once assuring the algorithm finds a local minimum in R2C , some shifted truncation of the ground truth kernel a0 can be recovered.",
        "2: Solve following nonconvex optimization problem with a descent algorithm that escapes saddle point and find a local minimizer q = arg minq\u2208Sk\u22121 \u03c6 (q)",
        "At a stationary point q, if Hess [\u03c6] (q) is positive semidefinite, the function is convex and q is a local minimum; if Hess [\u03c6] (q) has a negative eigenvalue, there exists a direction along which the objective value decreases and q is a saddle point.",
        "This implies that every local minimizer of the finite sample objective function is close to a preconditioned shift-truncation.",
        "Reliable recovery of the shift truncation of a generic kernel can be guaranteed even when the sparse signal is relatively dense (\u03b8 \u223c k\u22122/3).",
        "If the convolution kernel a0 is lowpass, \u03c3min decreases, and \u03ba, \u03bc increase, more observations m and smaller sparsity level \u03b8 is required for the proposed algorithm to perform as desired."
