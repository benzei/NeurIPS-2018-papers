        "abstract": "We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of trajectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i) a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional configuration space to a small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii) a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facilitates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples the conditional distribution of configurations in the next time step. The model can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the system evolution from a defined starting state and propose new configurations. The DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time kinetics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long timesteps in molecular configuration space and generate physically realistic structures in regions that were not seen in training data."

    "summary": [
        "Complex dynamical systems that exhibit events on vastly different timescales are ubiquitous in science and engineering.",
        "All of these methods are purely analytic, i.e. they learn a reduced model of the dynamical system underlying the observed time series, but they miss a generative part that could be used to sample new time series in the high-dimensional configuration space.",
        "\u2013 they learn a mapping from configurations to metastable states, where they aim obtaining a good approximation of the kinetics of the underlying dynamical system, by means of the transition matrix",
        "In contrast to DeepResampleMSM, we want to learn deep generative MSM (DeepGenMSM), which can be used to generate trajectories that do not only resample from input data, but can produce genuinely new configurations.",
        "The transition matrix can be obtained by using the rewiring trick (Fig. 1), where the configuration space integral is sampled by generating samples from the generator:",
        "This is expected from approximation theory, as the DeepResampleMSMs represents the four metastable states with a meaningful, smooth membership functions \u03c7, while the four-state MSM cuts the memberships hard at boundaries with low sample density (Supplementary Fig. 1).",
        "The fact that we can still get approximately correct results for stationary, kinetics and dynamical properties encourages us to use DeepGenMSMs for a higher-dimensional example, where the generation of configurations is a hard problem.",
        "The relaxation timescales estimated by a six-state DeepResampleMSM are significantly better than with six-state standard MSMs. MSMs with 100 states have a similar performance as the deep MSMs but this comes at the cost of a model with a much larger latent space.",
        "We perform an experiment to test whether the DeepGenMSM is able to generate genuinely new configurations that do exist for Alanine dipeptide but have not been seen in the training data.",
        "A DeepGenMSM that makes leaps of length \u03c4 \u2013 orders of magnitude larger than the MD simulation time-step \u2013 and has even a small chance of generating new and meaningful structures would be extremely valuable to discover new states and thereby accelerate MD sampling.",
        "Deep MSMs provide high-quality models of the stationary and kinetic properties for stochastic dynamical systems such as MD simulations.",
        "It was shown that generating dynamical trajectories in a 30-dimensional molecular configuration space results in sampling of physically realistic molecular structures.",
        "While Alanine dipeptide is a small system compared to proteins and other macromolecules that are of biological interest, our results demonstrate that efficient sampling of new molecular structures is possible with generative dynamic models, and improved methods can be built upon this."
