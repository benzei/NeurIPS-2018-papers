It is well known that objects that have a symmetric structure do not usually result in symmetric images due to articulation and perspective effects. This is often tackled by seeking the intrinsic symmetries of the underlying 3D shape, which is very difficult to do when the latter cannot be recovered reliably from data. We show that, if only raw images are given, it is possible to look instead for symmetries in the space of object deformations. We can then learn symmetries from an unstructured collection of images of the object as an extension of the recently-introduced object frame representation, modified so that object symmetries reduce to the obvious symmetry groups in the normalized space. We also show that our formulation provides an explanation of the ambiguities that arise in recovering the pose of symmetric objects from their shape or images and we provide a way of discounting such ambiguities in learning."

    "summary": [
        "Most natural objects are symmetric: mammals have a bilateral symmetry, a glass is rotationally symmetric, many flowers have a radial symmetry, etc.",
        "We seek a new approach to learn without supervision and from raw images alone the symmetries of deformable object categories.",
        "An important step in this generalization is to characterise the ambiguities that symmetries induce in recovering the pose of an object from an image of it, or from its 3D shape, which may not occur with bilateral symmetries.",
        "The resulting approach is the first that, to our knowledge, can learn the symmetries of object categories given only raw images as input, without manual annotations.",
        "For objects such as animals that have a bilateral symmetry, it is generally possible to uniquely identify their left and right sides and recover their pose uniquely.",
        "We extend the approach of [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] to learn the bilateral symmetry of an object category.",
        "We have given a formulation for learning the bilateral symmetry of an object category, relying mostly on an intuitive derivation.",
        "2. Even if poses \u03a0 are closed under rigid motions (i.e. G\u2217\u03a0 = \u03a0 where G\u2217 = SE(3)), in this case there is generally no ambiguity in recovering the object pose from its shape S.",
        "This explains why it is possible to still distinguish left from right sides in most bilaterally-symmetric objects despite symmetries and motions.",
        "It is not possible to recover the object pose uniquely from an image, which in turn suggests that \u03c8u(x) cannot be learned using the formulation of section 3.",
        "We show that our extension successfully recovers the symmetric structure of bilateral objects as well as allowing to manage ambiguities arising from symmetries in learning such structures.",
        "Our new formulation localises the intrinsic bilateral symmetry plane in the face images and maps it to a plane of reflection in the embedding space.",
        "This is expected as the mapping m has no particular meaning in this embedding space; for a fairer comparison, we explicitly estimate an ad-hoc plane of symmetry defined by the nose, mean of the eyes, and mean of the mouth corners, using 200 training images.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that it is flexible and robust enough that it supports learning symmetric objects in an unsupervised manner, from raw images, despite variable viewpoint, deformations, and intra-class variations.",
        "Our contributions have been validated empirically, showing that we can learn to represent symmetries robustly on a variety of object categories, while retaining the accuracy of the learned geometric embedding compared to previous approaches."
