        "abstract": "The design of flow control systems remains a challenge due to the nonlinear nature of the equations that govern fluid flow. However, recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have enabled the simulation of complex fluid flows with high accuracy, opening the possibility of using learning-based approaches to facilitate controller design. We present a method for learning the forced and unforced dynamics of airflow over a cylinder directly from CFD data. The proposed approach, grounded in Koopman theory, is shown to produce stable dynamical models that can predict the time evolution of the cylinder system over extended time horizons. Finally, by performing model predictive control with the learned dynamical models, we are able to find a straightforward, interpretable control law for suppressing vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder."

        "Fluid flow control represents a significant challenge, with the potential for high impact in a variety of sectors, most notably the automotive and aerospace industries.",
        "We present the Deep Koopman model, which employs a modified form of the training algorithm proposed by Takeishi et al to learn state mappings that approximately span a Koopman invariant subspace.",
        "The matrices At, Bt, and Ct are assumed to comprise a locally linear dynamical model, and are determined at each time step as a function of the current latent state and control input.",
        "The Koopman method construct its dynamical model based on state mappings from the first 16 time steps, simulates the system for all time steps using the derived A-matrix.",
        "We see that the Deep Koopman model, aided by its ability to construct state mappings that approximately span an invariant subspace, is able to generate stable predictions for much longer time horizons.",
        "We explain how the proposed Deep Koopman algorithm can be extended to account for the effect that control inputs have on the time evolution of dynamical systems.",
        "We have already demonstrated how the Deep Koopman algorithm can learn state mappings that are suitable for modeling unforced dynamics.",
        "With the ability to train Koopman models that account for control inputs, we consider a modified version the two-dimensional cylinder test case that allows for a scalar control input to affect the fluid flow.",
        "The form of control inputs applied to the system in generating the training data has a strong effect on the quality of learned models.",
        "This aligns with the Deep Koopman model training process, where the neural network generates predictions for 16 time steps beyond what it uses to construct its dynamical model.",
        "In Fig. 4, we get a qualitative picture for the effectiveness of the applied control, as the cylinder wake exhibits a curved region of low x-momentum characteristic of vortex shedding at early time steps, flattens out to a profile more characteristic of laminar flow over time.",
        "Given that both Koopman-centric approaches and SRL attempt to discover state mappings that are useful for describing the time evolution of high-dimensional systems, an opportunity likely exists to bridge the gap between these fields.",
        "We introduced a method for training Deep Koopman models, demonstrating that the learned models were capable of stably simulating airflow over a cylinder for significant prediction horizons.",
