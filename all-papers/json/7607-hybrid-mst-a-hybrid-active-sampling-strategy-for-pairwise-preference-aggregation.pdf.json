        "abstract": "In this paper we present a hybrid active sampling strategy for pairwise preference aggregation, which aims at recovering the underlying rating of the test candidates from sparse and noisy pairwise labelling. Our method employs Bayesian optimization framework and Bradley-Terry model to construct the utility function, then to obtain the Expected Information Gain (EIG) of each pair. For computational efficiency, Gaussian-Hermite quadrature is used for estimation of EIG. In this work, a hybrid active sampling strategy is proposed, either using Global Maximum (GM) EIG sampling or Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) sampling in each trial, which is determined by the test budget. The proposed method has been validated on both simulated and real-world datasets, where it shows higher preference aggregation ability than the state-of-the-art methods."

        "Preference aggregation from annotators\u2019 pairwise labeling on the test candidates is a traditional but still active research topic.",
        "The main contributions of our work are highlighted as follows: 1) Batch mode facility: When the number of test candidates is n, the proposed Hybrid-MST active sampling strategy allows for n \u2212 1 parallel pairwise comparison each time.",
        "1Source code: https://github.com/jingnantes/hybrid-mst compared, and the HRRG (HodgeRank on Random Graph) method proposed by Xu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] where random graph is utilized and only connected vertices are compared, a Hodge theory based rank model (HodgeRank) is proposed to convert the sparse pairwise data to scale ratings.",
        "Qualitative analysis Under the condition that each annotator has a 10% probability that inverses the vote, according to Figure 3, Hodge-active shows the strongest performance than others in ranking aggregation (Kendall) when the test budget is small.",
        "With the increase of the trial number, the proposed Hybrid-MST method as well as the Crowd-BT shows comparable performance with Hodge-active.",
        "Regarding rating aggregation (PLCC and RMSE), the proposed Hybrid-MST method performs significantly better than the others except for that when the",
        "Crowd-BT shows similar performance with ARD in rating aggregation, which is lower than Hybrid-MST and Hodge-active but higher than HRRG.",
        "The mean of Kendall, PLCC and RMSE are used in a way that if D pairwise comparisons in Hybrid-MST/Hodge-active/Crowd-BT could achieve the same precision as the FPC with 15 standard trial numbers, the saving budget Bs is: D",
        "The time cost of a whole pairwise comparison procedure including stimuli presentation time and voting time in a typical VQA experiment is shown in Table 2, which demonstrates that our method Hybrid-MST is particularly applicable in large-scale crowd sourcing experiment.",
        "Regarding the ranking aggregation ability (Kendall), though Hodge-active still shows a bit stronger performance in ranking aggregation than Hybrid-MST when the trial number is small, it is not as much as in the simulated data.",
        "Both simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that when the test budget is limited (2-3 standard trial numbers) and the objective is ranking aggregation, i.e. we care more about the rank order of the test candidates rather than their underlying scores, using Hodge-active is safer than Hybrid-MST.",
        "Pair sampling is a hybrid strategy which takes advantages of both GM method and MST method, allowing for better ranking and rating aggregation in small and large trial number conditions.",
        "In crowd-sourcing platform, the proposed batch-mode MST method could boost the pairwise comparison procedure significantly by parallel labeling."
