        "abstract": "Natural scenes contain many layers of part-subpart structure, and distributions over them are thus naturally represented by stochastic image grammars, with one production per decomposition of a part. Unfortunately, in contrast to language grammars, where the number of possible split points for a production A \u2192 BC is linear in the length of A, in an image there are an exponential number of ways to split a region into subregions. This makes parsing intractable and requires image grammars to be severely restricted in practice, for example by allowing only rectangular regions. In this paper, we address this problem by associating with each production a submodular Markov random field whose labels are the subparts and whose labeling segments the current object into these subparts. We call the resulting model a submodular field grammar (SFG). Finding the MAP split of a region into subregions is now tractable, and by exploiting this we develop an efficient approximate algorithm for MAP parsing of images with SFGs. Empirically, we show promising improvements in accuracy when using SFGs for scene understanding, and demonstrate exponential improvements in inference time compared to traditional methods, while returning comparable minima."

        "Fusion requires finding the optimal labeling from an exponentially large set, two parse trees can be fused with a single graph cut by exploiting submodularity.",
        "Proposition 2 shows that each iteration of SFG-PARSE has complexity O(|G|c(n)n), where n is the number of pixels and c(n) is the complexity of the graph-cut algorithm, which is low-order polynomial in n in the worst case, but nearly linear-time in practice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
        "Note that directly applying \u03b1-expansion to parsing an SFG requires optimizing an MRF with one label for each path in the grammar, which would take time exponential in the height of the grammar.",

        "To evaluate SFGs as a model of natural scenes, we segmented images at multiple levels of granularity, used these segmentations to generate SFGs over the DeepLab features, and compared the segmentation accuracy resulting from parsing the generated SFGs using SFG-PARSE to that of using (a) DeepLab features alone and (b) a planar submodular MRF on the DeepLab features.",
        "We compared the performance of SFG-PARSE to that of running \u03b1-expansion on a flat pairwise MRF containing one label for each possible parse path in the grammar and to running BP on a multi-level (3-D) pairwise MRF with the same height as the grammar.",
        "To evaluate whether natural scenes exhibit the compositional part-subpart structure over arbitrarilyshaped regions that SFGs can capture but previous methods cannot, we generated grammars on SBD images where the semantic labels were the terminals.",
