        "abstract": "We consider the semi-supervised clustering problem where crowdsourcing provides noisy information about the pairwise comparisons on a small subset of data, i.e., whether a sample pair is in the same cluster. We propose a new approach that includes a deep generative model (DGM) to characterize low-level features of the data, and a statistical relational model for noisy pairwise annotations on its subset. The two parts share the latent variables. To make the model automatically trade-off between its complexity and fitting data, we also develop its fully Bayesian variant. The challenge of inference is addressed by fast (natural-gradient) stochastic variational inference algorithms, where we effectively combine variational message passing for the relational part and amortized learning of the DGM under a unified framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms previous crowdsourced clustering methods."

        "Similar to Section 2.3, we can approximate the variational lower bound with unbiased estimates using mini-batches of data and annotations, getting a stochastic natural gradient.",

        "In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] the authors propose using recognition networks to produce conjugate graphical model potentials, so that traditional variational message passing algorithms and natural gradient updates can be combined with amortized learning of network parameters.",

        "We observe that our method consistently outperforms all competing methods, demonstrating that the clustering benefits from the joint generative modeling of inputs and annotations.",
