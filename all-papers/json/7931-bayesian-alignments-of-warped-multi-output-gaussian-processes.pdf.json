        "abstract": "We propose a novel Bayesian approach to modelling nonlinear alignments of time series based on latent shared information. We apply the method to the real-world problem of finding common structure in the sensor data of wind turbines introduced by the underlying latent and turbulent wind field. The proposed model allows for both arbitrary alignments of the inputs and non-parametric output warpings to transform the observations. This gives rise to multiple deep Gaussian process models connected via latent generating processes. We present an efficient variational approximation based on nested variational compression and show how the model can be used to extract shared information between dependent time series, recovering an interpretable functional decomposition of the learning problem. We show results for an artificial data set and real-world data of two wind turbines."

        "The convolutions of the latent processes generating the different outputs are all performed around the same point x.",
        "Together with the warping layers gd, our model can learn to share knowledge in an informative latent space learnt from the data.",
        "This model can be interpreted as a shared and warped latent variable model with a very specific prior: The indices X are part of the prior for the latent space ad(X) and specify a sense of order for the different data points y which is augmented with uncertainty by the alignment functions.",
        "We will first apply the AMO-GP to an artificial data set in which we define a decomposed system of dependent time series by specifying a shared latent function generating the observations together",
        "We focus on a real world data set of a neighbouring pair of wind turbines in a wind farm, where the model is able to recover a representation of the latent prevailing wind condition and the relative timings of wind fronts at the two turbines.",
        "Since we assume our artificial data simulates a physical system, we apply the prior knowledge that the alignment and warping processes have slower dynamics compared to the shared latent function which should capture most of the observed dynamics.",
        "The model successfully recovered a shared latent dampened sine function, a sigmoid warping for the first time series and an approximate quadratic alignment function for the second time series.",
        "Uncertainties in the deep GP are placed in the middle layer areas where no data are available for the respective time series, as sharing information between the two outputs is impossible.",
        "For the given data set we can assume the output warpings gd to be linear functions because there is only one dimension, the power generation, which in this data set is of similar shape for both turbines.",
        "We have proposed the warped and aligned multi-output Gaussian process (AMO-GP), in which MOGPs are embedded in a hierarchy to find shared structure in latent spaces.",
        "We compared the model with GPs, deep GPs and multi-output GPs on an artificial data set and showed how the richer model-structure allows the AMO-GP to pick up on latent structure which the other approaches cannot model.",
        "We applied the AMO-GP to real world data of two wind turbines and used the proposed hierarchy to model wind propagation in a wind farm and recover information about the latent non homogeneous wind field.",
        "By applying nested variational compression [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] to inference in these models, we presented a variational lower bound which combines Bayesian treatment of all parts of the model with scalability via stochastic optimization"
