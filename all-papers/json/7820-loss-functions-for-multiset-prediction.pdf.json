        "abstract": "We study the problem of multiset prediction. The goal of multiset prediction is to train a predictor that maps an input to a multiset consisting of multiple items. Unlike existing problems in supervised learning, such as classification, ranking and sequence generation, there is no known order among items in a target multiset, and each item in the multiset may appear more than once, making this problem extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiset loss function by viewing this problem from the perspective of sequential decision making. The proposed multiset loss function is empirically evaluated on two families of datasets, one synthetic and the other real, with varying levels of difficulty, against various baseline loss functions including reinforcement learning, sequence, and aggregated distribution matching loss functions. The experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed loss function over the others."

    "summary": [
        "A relatively less studied problem in machine learning, particularly supervised learning, is the problem of multiset prediction.",
        "This loss function is best motivated by treating the multiset prediction problem as a sequential decision making process with a model being considered a policy \u03c0.",
        ", yT ) by executing the parametrized policy until either all the items in the target multiset have been predicted or the predefined maximum number of steps have passed.",
        "Variable-Sized Multisets In order to predict variable-sized multisets with the proposed loss functions, we introduce a termination policy \u03c0s, which outputs a stop distribution given the predicted sequence of items y<t and the input x.",
        "Our proposal can be seen as designing an oracle and loss with favorable properties for multiset prediction, using a learned roll-in \u03c0\u03b8, and directly setting a cost vector equal to the oracle\u2019s distribution, avoiding the expensive per-step roll-out in SeaRNN.",
        "The performance difference between the first two strategies was not significant, so from here on we choose the simpler method, greedy decoding, when training a model with the proposed multiset loss function.",
        "We compare the proposed multiset loss function against the five baseline loss functions: reinforcement learning LRL, aggregate distribution matching\u2013Ld1m and LKdmL\u2013, its one-step variant L1-step, and sequence prediction Lseq, introduced in Section 3.",
        "MS COCO Similar to the results on the variants of MNIST Multi, the proposed multiset loss function matches or outperforms all the others on the two variants of MS COCO, as presented in Table 3 (b).",
        "On COCO Easy, with only two objects to predict per example, both aggregated distribution matching and the sequence loss functions are as competitive as the proposed multiset loss.",
        "This naturally follows from the fact that there is no pre-specified rank function, because the oracle policy cannot prefer any item from the others in a free label multiset.",
        "We consider the policies trained entropies of predictive distributions on MNIST Multi (10), where the differences among them compared over the validation set.",
        "As shown in Fig. 1, the policy trained on MNIST Multi (10) using the proposed multiset loss closely follows the oracle policy.",
        "An oracle policy was defined and shown to be optimal, and a new loss function, called multiset loss, was introduced as a means to train a parametrized policy for multiset prediction.",
        "The experiments on two families of datasets, MNIST Multi variants and MS COCO variants, have revealed the effectiveness of the proposed loss function over other loss functions including reinforcement learning, sequence, and aggregated distribution matching loss functions.",
        "This success brings in new opportunities of applying machine learning to various new domains, including high-energy physics"
