        "abstract": "Various 3D semantic attributes such as segmentation masks, geometric features, keypoints, and materials can be encoded as per-point probe functions on 3D geometries. Given a collection of related 3D shapes, we consider how to jointly analyze such probe functions over different shapes, and how to discover common latent structures using a neural network \u2014 even in the absence of any correspondence information. Our network is trained on point cloud representations of shape geometry and associated semantic functions on that point cloud. These functions express a shared semantic understanding of the shapes but are not coordinated in any way. For example, in a segmentation task, the functions can be indicator functions of arbitrary sets of shape parts, with the particular combination involved not known to the network. Our network is able to produce a small dictionary of basis functions for each shape, a dictionary whose span includes the semantic functions provided for that shape. Even though our shapes have independent discretizations and no functional correspondences are provided, the network is able to generate latent bases, in a consistent order, that reflect the shared semantic structure among the shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in various segmentation and keypoint selection applications."

        "It is common practice to encode 3D shape information such as segmentation masks, geometric features, keypoints, reflectance, materials, etc. as per-point functions defined on the shape surface, known as probe functions.",
        "Approach Instead of a two-stage procedure to first build independent functional spaces and relate them through correspondences, we propose a novel correspondencefree framework that directly learns consistent bases across a shape collection that reflect the shared structure of the set of probe functions.",
        "We test our model with existing neural network architectures, and demonstrate the performance on labeled/unlabeled segmentation and keypoint correspondence problem in various datasets.",
        "General Framework We propose a simple yet effective loss function, which can be applied to any neural network architecture processing a 3D geometry as inputs.",
        "The neural network takes pairs of a shape X including n points and function f \u2208 Rn as inputs in training, and outputs a matrix A(X ; \u0398) \u2208 Rn\u00d7k as a dictionary of functions on the shape.",
        "X is an input shape (n points), f is an input function defined on X , \u0398t is neural network weights at time t, A(X ; \u0398t) is an output dictionary of functions on X , C(x) is the constraints on x, and \u03b7 is learning rate.",
        "We take a random subset of keypoints of each shape to feed an input function, and predict a function dictionary in which atoms indicate every single keypoint.",

        "We report the average mean IoUs when finding the best correspondences between part labels and the indices of dictionary atoms per category.",
        "Such synchronized atomic functions can be utilized in transferring any information on one shape to the other without having point-wise correspondences.",

        "The learning framework we proposed predicts a function dictionary of each shape that spans input semantic functions, and finds the atomic functions in a consistent order without any correspondence information.",
        "We have shown some examples of constraints in the loss function that can allow the atomic functions to have desired properties in specific applications: the smallest parts in segmentation, and single points in keypoint correspondence.",
