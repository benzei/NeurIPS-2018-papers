        "abstract": "Nash equilibrium strategies have the known weakness that they do not prescribe rational play in situations that are reached with zero probability according to the strategies themselves, for example, if players have made mistakes. Tremblinghand refinements\u2014such as extensive-form perfect equilibria and quasi-perfect equilibria\u2014remedy this problem in sound ways. Despite their appeal, they have not received attention in practice since no known algorithm for computing them scales beyond toy instances. In this paper, we design an exact polynomial-time algorithm for finding trembling-hand equilibria in zero-sum extensive-form games. It is several orders of magnitude faster than the best prior ones, numerically stable, and quickly solves game instances with tens of thousands of nodes in the game tree. It enables, for the first time, the use of trembling-hand refinements in practice."

        "The two most famous trembling-hand solution concepts that refine NEs while guaranteeing sequential rationality are quasi-perfect equilibria (QPEs) [van Damme, 1984] and extensive-form perfect equilibria (EFPEs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSelten_1975_a\" href=\"#rSelten_1975_a\">Selten, 1975</a>].1 In a QPE, a player plays optimally at every information set taking into account possible future mistakes of her opponent but assuming that she will not make future mistakes.",
        "In two-player zero-sum games, the problems of finding a QPE or an EFPE can be formulated as limit points of linear programs parameterized by the tremble magnitude.",

        "In a zero-sum extensive-form game with perfect recall, a limit point as \u2193 0 of solutions of the linear problem in Figure 1(a) is the strategy of player i \u2208 {1, 2} in a QPE.",

        "The previous section shows that the problems of finding a QPE and that of finding an EFPE are similar: in both cases an LP with a parameter > 0 is given, and a limit point of a sequence of optimal solutions to the LP as \u2193 0 is sought.",
        "Given a stable basis, one can find a TLP limit solution in polynomial time: Theorem 5.",
        "If in the QPE formulation of Proposition 1, the LP constraint matrix A is constant, meaning that the optimality certificate b has polynomial entries, it is extremely easy to deal with.",
