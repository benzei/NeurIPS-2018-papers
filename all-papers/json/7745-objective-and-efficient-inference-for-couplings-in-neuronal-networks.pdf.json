        "abstract": "Inferring directional couplings from the spike data of networks is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience. Here, we apply a recently proposed objective procedure to the spike data obtained from the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley type models and in vitro neuronal networks cultured in a circular structure. As a result, we succeed in reconstructing synaptic connections accurately from the evoked activity as well as the spontaneous one. To obtain the results, we invent an analytic formula approximately implementing a method of screening relevant couplings. This significantly reduces the computational cost of the screening method employed in the proposed objective procedure, making it possible to treat large-size systems as in this study."

        "Recent advances in experimental techniques make it possible to simultaneously record the activity of multiple units.",
        "We implement this situation both in the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model and in a cultured neuronal network of a previously described design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], and test the methods in both the cases.",
        "We address those three points by employing the simple kinetic Ising model, to efficiently infer synaptic couplings in neuronal networks.",
        "We generate their time series, integrating (12)-(15) by the Euler method with d\u03c4 = 0.01 ms, where we suppose a neuron is firing when its voltage exceeds Vth, and use the spike train data with the whole period T = 106 ms for our inference.",
        "To validate our approximation (8), we randomize the co\u221aarse-grained series with \u2206\u03c4 = 3 ms in the time direction independently, rescale Jirjan by multiplying (1 \u2212 \u03bci2)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2j )(M \u2212 1), and compare the results of 1000 randomized data with the standard Gauss distribution in Fig. 1 (c), which shows their good correspondence.",
        "Using \u2206\u03c4 = 3 ms to make the spike trains coarse-grained, we apply the inverse formula to the series and screen relevant couplings with pth = 10\u22123, which leads to the estimated coupling matrix shown in Fig. 1 (e), while the one used to generate the data is shown in Fig. 1 (d).",
        "To illustrate the robustness of the optimality of the time bin, in Fig. 1 (i) we plot the means and standard deviations of the gross mutual information through the 10 different simulations, showing that the variance is small enough and the result is well robust.",
        "We calculate the gross mutual information as in case of the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley models, and the obtained optimal bin size is approximately \u2206\u03c4 = 5 ms.",
        "We confirm that the inferred couplings are similar to the results described previously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], and this supports the validity of our novel approximation method introduced in Sec. 2.3.",
        "The inferred network with the strict threshold pth = 10\u22129 is displayed in Fig. 4 (e), where some long-range couplings are still estimated while physical connections corresponding to them do not exist because of the experimental design.",
        "The contribution of this study is three-fold: (i) invention of an analytic formula to screen relevant couplings in a computationally efficient manner; examination in the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model, with and without impulse stimuli; examination in an evoked cultured neuronal network.",
        "The application to the real data of the spontaneous activity in the cultured neuronal system highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methods in detecting the synaptic connections."
