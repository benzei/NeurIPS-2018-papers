        "abstract": "Embedding complex objects as vectors in low dimensional spaces is a longstanding problem in machine learning. We propose in this work an extension of that approach, which consists in embedding objects as elliptical probability distributions, namely distributions whose densities have elliptical level sets. We endow these measures with the 2-Wasserstein metric, with two important benefits: (i) For such measures, the squared 2-Wasserstein metric has a closed form, equal to a weighted sum of the squared Euclidean distance between means and the squared Bures metric between covariance matrices. The latter is a Riemannian metric between positive semi-definite matrices, which turns out to be Euclidean on a suitable factor representation of such matrices, which is valid on the entire geodesic between these matrices. (ii) The 2-Wasserstein distance boils down to the usual Euclidean metric when comparing Diracs, and therefore provides a natural framework to extend point embeddings. We show that for these reasons Wasserstein elliptical embeddings are more intuitive and yield tools that are better behaved numerically than the alternative choice of Gaussian embeddings with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In particular, and unlike previous work based on the KL geometry, we learn elliptical distributions that are not necessarily diagonal. We demonstrate the advantages of elliptical embeddings by using them for visualization, to compute embeddings of words, and to reflect entailment or hypernymy."

        "One of the holy grails of machine learning is to compute meaningful low-dimensional embeddings for high-dimensional complex data.",
        "For the purpose of this work, we will only require the following result: the variance of an elliptical measure is equal to its scale parameter C multiplied by a scalar that only depends on its characteristic generator.",
        "When considering a general loss function L that take as arguments squared Bures distances, one can show that L is geodesically convex w.r.t. to scale matrices A if and only if it is convex in the usual sense with respect to L, where A = LLT .",
        "Vilnis and McCallum [2015] extended this approach to diagonal Gaussian embeddings using an energy whose overall principles we adopt here, adapted to elliptical distributions with full covariance matrices in the 2-Wasserstein space.",
        "We consider an input and an ouput representation as an elliptical measure, denoted respectively \u03bcw and \u232bw, both parameterized by a location vector and a scale parameter.",
        "For a fair comparison across methods, we set dimensions by ensuring that the number of free parameters remains the same: because of the symmetry in the covariance matrix, elliptical embeddings in dimension d have d + d(d + 1)/2 free parameters (d for the means, d(d + 1)/2 for the covariance matrices), as compared with 2d for diagonal Gaussians.",
        "Using this similarity measure rather than the Wasserstein-Bures dot product is motivated by the fact that the norms of the embeddings show some dependency with word frequencies and become dominant when comparing words with different frequencies scales.",
        "Using the W2 metric we can provides a natural and seamless generalization of point embeddings in Rd. Each embedding is described with a location c and a scale C parameter, the latter being represented in practice using a factor matrix L, where C is recovered as LLT .",
        "In that case a natural upper bound on the W2 distance can be computed by solving the OT problem between these mixtures of Gaussians using a simpler proxy: consider them as discrete measures putting Dirac masses in the space of Gaussians endowed with the W2 metric as a ground cost, and use the optimal cost of that proxy as an upper bound of their Wasserstein distance.",
        "These k points, whose mean and covariance matrix match c and C, can fully characterize the geometric properties of the distribution \u03bcc,C, and may provide a simple form of multimodal embedding."
