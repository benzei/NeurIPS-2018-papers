        "abstract": "Graph matching has received persistent attention over several decades, which can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). We show that a large family of functions, which we define as Separable Functions, can approximate discrete graph matching in the continuous domain asymptotically by varying the approximation controlling parameters. We also study the properties of global optimality and devise convex/concave-preserving extensions to the widely used Lawler\u2019s QAP form. Our theoretical findings show the potential for deriving new algorithms and techniques for graph matching. We deliver solvers based on two specific instances of Separable Functions, and the state-of-the-art performance of our method is verified on popular benchmarks."
