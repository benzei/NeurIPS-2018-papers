        "abstract": "Deep learning has become increasingly popular in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning thanks to its outstanding empirical performance. However, because of their intrinsic complexity, most deep learning methods are largely treated as black box tools with little interpretability. Even though recent attempts have been made to facilitate the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs), existing methods are susceptible to noise and lack of robustness. Therefore, scientists are justifiably cautious about the reproducibility of the discoveries, which is often related to the interpretability of the underlying statistical models. In this paper, we describe a method to increase the interpretability and reproducibility of DNNs by incorporating the idea of feature selection with controlled error rate. By designing a new DNN architecture and integrating it with the recently proposed knockoffs framework, we perform feature selection with a controlled error rate, while maintaining high power. This new method, DeepPINK (Deep feature selection using Paired-Input Nonlinear Knockoffs), is applied to both simulated and real data sets to demonstrate its empirical utility."

        "The model-X knockoffs framework provides an elegant way to achieve FDR control in a feature selection setting at some target level q in finite sample and with arbitrary dependency structure between the response and features.",
        "If we can construct a set of model-X knockoff features, by comparing the original features with these control features, FDR can be controlled at target level q.",
        "We integrate the idea of knockoff filters with DNNs to achieve feature selection with controlled FDR.",
        "The main idea of DeepPINK is to feed the network through a plugin pairwise-coupling layer containing p filters, F1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fp, where the jth filter connects feature Xj and its knockoff counterpart Xj. Initialized the corresponding filter weights Zj and Zj compete against each other during training.",
        "With the above introduced importance measures Zj and Zj, the knockoff statistic can be defined as Wj = Zj2 \u2212 Zj2, and the filtering step can be applied to the Wj\u2019s to select features.",
        "We see that DeepPINK consistently control FDR much below the target level even though we choose a pretty loose threshold and has the highest power among the competing methods in almost all settings.",
        "MLP, DeepLIFT, and RF control FDR at the target level, but in each case the power is very sensitive to dimensionality and model nonlinearity.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the superiority of DeepPINK over MLP and DeepLIFT lies in the pairwise-coupling layer, which encourages the importance competition between original and knockoff features directly.",
        "We apply three different methods to the data set: DeepPINK with model-X knockoffs discussed earlier in this paper, the original fixed-X knockoff filter based on a Gaussian linear model (Knockoff) proposed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], and the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg (BHq) procedure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
        "We have introduced a new method, DeepPINK, that can help to interpret a deep neural network model by identifying a subset of relevant input features, subject to the FDR control.",
        "DeepPINK employs a particular DNN architecture, namely, a plugin pairwise-coupling layer, to encourage competitions between each original feature and its knockoff counterpart.",
        "DeepPINK achieves FDR control with much higher power than the naive combination of the knockoffs idea with a vanilla MLP.",
        "Extending DeepPINK to other neural networks such as CNN and RNN would be interesting directions for future"
