        "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning optimal reserve price in repeated auctions against non-myopic bidders, who may bid strategically in order to gain in future rounds even if the single-round auctions are truthful. Previous algorithms, e.g., empirical pricing, do not provide non-trivial regret rounds in this setting in general. We introduce algorithms that obtain a small regret against non-myopic bidders either when the market is large, i.e., no single bidder appears in more than a small constant fraction of the rounds, or when the bidders are impatient, i.e., they discount future utility by some factor mildly bounded away from one. Our approach carefully controls what information is revealed to each bidder, and builds on techniques from differentially private online learning as well as the recent line of works on jointly differentially private algorithms."

        "The problem of designing revenue-optimal auctions based on data has drawn much attention in the algorithmic game theory community lately.",
        "Can we extend the online learning model to allow non-myopic bidders, and design algorithms that provably have small regret against the best fixed auction?",
        "We will design online auctions such that (1) deviating too far from the true value in the current round is always costly, and (2) the influence of the current bid on future prices/utilities is bounded.",
        "Running a follow-the-perturbed-leader algorithm with tree-aggregation as in the single-bidder case does not work in the multi-bidder setting because a bidder\u2019s current bid can affect other bidders\u2019 subsequent bid through the allocations and payments in the current round.",
        "The joint privacy of single-round auctions together with the previous argument on the learning process bound how much a bidder\u2019s current bid can affect his future utility.",
        "For any bidder and any day t on which he comes, the bidder\u2019s equilibria utilities in subsequent rounds in the subgames induced by different bids on day t differ by at most an e multiplicative factor plus a \u03b4T additive factor.",
        "Our proof shows that no matter what a bidder\u2019s belief is on the other bidders\u2019 values and strategies, assuming she always plays best-response under her belief in subsequent rounds, the future utility differ by at most an e multiplicative factor.",
        "Since tree-aggregation is differentially private, the online pricing algorithm is private treating the bid on each day as an entry of the dataset.",
        "We shall interpret the execution of the online pricing algorithm, i.e., the algorithm together with the bidders\u2019 strategies in subsequent rounds, after round t as a post-processing on the internal states of the tree-aggregation algorithm at the end of day t and, is ( , \u03b4)-differentially private due to Lemma 3.3.",
        "For any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), our algorithm runs an approximate version of Vickrey with an anonymous reserve price on each day with regret \u2264 \u03b1mT against the best fixed reserve price if:",
        "Running Vickrey with the chosen reserve price does not guarantee stability of future utility, because a bidder\u2019s current bid can affect other bidders\u2019 subsequent bids through the allocations and payments in the current round.",
        "The subsequent execution of the algorithm can be viewed as a post-processing on the internal states of tree-aggregation together with the other bidders\u2019 memberships w.r.t. S and the price p on day t, which are differentially private due to Lemma 3.3 and the privacy property of PMatch in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]."
