        "abstract": "From a single image, humans are able to perceive the full 3D shape of an object by exploiting learned shape priors from everyday life. Contemporary single-image 3D reconstruction algorithms aim to solve this task in a similar fashion, but often end up with priors that are highly biased by training classes. Here we present an algorithm, Generalizable Reconstruction (GenRe), designed to capture more generic, class-agnostic shape priors. We achieve this with an inference network and training procedure that combine 2.5D representations of visible surfaces (depth and silhouette), spherical shape representations of both visible and non-visible surfaces, and 3D voxel-based representations, in a principled manner that exploits the causal structure of how 3D shapes give rise to 2D images. Experiments demonstrate that GenRe performs well on single-view shape reconstruction, and generalizes to diverse novel objects from categories not seen during training."

    "summary": [
        "Humans can imagine an object\u2019s full 3D shape from just a single image, showing only a fraction of the object\u2019s surface.",
        "Such a representation combines appealing features of 2D and 3D: spherical maps are a form of 2D images, on which neural inpainting models work well; but they have a semantics that allows them to be projected into 3D to recover full shape geometry.",
        "We demonstrate that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image 3D shape reconstruction for objects within and outside training classes.",
        "It takes two 3D shapes as input, one projected from the inpainted spherical map and the other from the estimated depth map, and outputs a final 3D shape.",
        "We observe that networks trained to inpaint spherical maps generalize well to new shape classes (Figure 3).",
        "This module takes two voxelized shapes as input, one projected from the estimated depth map and the other from the inpainted spherical map, and predicts the final shape.",
        "As shown in the experiments, when provided with ground-truth depth and spherical maps, this module performs consistently well across training and unseen classes.",
        "The spherical map inpainting network has a similar architecture as the single-view depth estimator.",
        "Our voxel refinement network takes as input voxels projected from the estimated, original-view depth and from the inpainted spherical map, and recovers the final shape in voxel space.",
        "We train the voxel refinement network on coarse shapes predicted by the inpainting network as well as 3D surfaces backprojected from the estimated 2.5D sketches, with the corresponding ground-truth shapes as supervision.",
        "To provide a performance upper bound for our spherical inpainting and voxel refinement networks (b and c in Figure 2), we include the results when our model has access to ground-truth depth in the original view (GenRe-Oracle) and to ground-truth full spherical maps (GenRe-SphOracle).",
        "Because neither depth maps nor spherical maps provide information inside shapes, our model predicts only surface voxels that are not guaranteed watertight.",
        "As the focus is mainly on the spherical map inpainting network (Figure 2b) and the voxel refinement network (Figure 2c), we assume our model has access to the ground-truth single-view depth (i.e., GenRe-Oracle) in this experiment.",
        "As demonstrated in Figure 8, our model not only retains the visible details in the original view, but completes the unseen surfaces using the generic shape priors learned from rigid objects.",
        "Similar to Section 5.2, the model has only seen cars, chairs, and airplanes during training, and we assume our model has access to the ground-truth single-view depth (i.e., GenRe-Oracle).",
        "We have proposed GenRe, a novel viewer-centered model that integrates these representations for generalizable, high-quality 3D shape reconstruction.",
        "We hope our system will inspire future research along this challenging but rewarding research direction"
