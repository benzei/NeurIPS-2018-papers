        "abstract": "Humans routinely retrace a path in a novel environment both forwards and backwards despite uncertainty in their motion. In this paper, we present an approach for doing so. Given a demonstration of a path, a first network generates an abstraction of the path. Equipped with this abstraction, a second network then observes the world and decides how to act in order to retrace the path under noisy actuation and a changing environment. The two networks are optimized end-to-end at training time. We evaluate the method in two realistic simulators, performing path following both forwards and backwards. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms both a classical approach to solving this task as well as a number of other baselines."

        "Consider the first morning of a conference in a city you have never been to.",
        "An agent learns in an end-to-end fashion from a set of images to perform a navigation task.",
        "We study the problem of retracing a path under noisy actuation and a changing world.",
        "At this time-scale, some works have framed the problem of navigation as learning to reach different goals in a fixed training environment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], designing policies that can directly act in new test environments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>], self-supervised learning for reaching goals in a well-traversed environment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] or by following a demonstration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].",
        "This action ais executed in the stochastic environment; the agent obtains the new visual observation at the state; and this process is repeated for a fixed number of time steps.",
        "Our policy function \u03a0 uses the observation O to implicitly localize the agent with respect to its memory of the path.",
        "The policy reads out relevant information and uses this in context of O to take an action that conveys the agent to the desired target location.",
        "The entire policy is implemented using neural network modules that are differentiable and learned end-to-end using training data for the task of efficiently going to the desired goal location.",
        "We use this path description with a learned controller that takes as input the current image observation O to output actions to follow the path under noisy actuation.",
        "This paper studies the task of retracing a route in a new environment under noisy actuation and a changing world given a demonstration.",
        "Note that this is a competitive comparison as the policy can learn to replay actions meaningfully in context of current images from the environment.",
        "All learned policies are trained in base settings: the noise level is at 20%, reference trajectories are of length 30, the policy is executed for 40 time steps, and these reference trajectories are sampled to be far from obstacles.",
        "We set up the homing task by sampling the same trajectories but providing images from a 180\u25e6 rotated camera at each reference location.",
        "As RPF learns features, it can better adapt to change in visual imagery in the synthetic dataset as compared to feature-based geometric methods.",
        "Not only does the agent need to be robust to visual changes between reference images and the current observations, but it must exhibit local going-around-behaviour as the reference trajectory may go through the newly added obstacles."
