In this paper, we develop a general metric for comparing nonlinear dynamical systems that is defined with Perron-Frobenius operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our metric includes the existing fundamental metrics for dynamical systems, which are basically defined with principal angles between some appropriately-chosen subspaces, as its special cases. We also describe the estimation of our metric from finite data. We empirically illustrate our metric with an example of rotation dynamics in a unit disk in a complex plane, and evaluate the performance with real-world time-series data."
