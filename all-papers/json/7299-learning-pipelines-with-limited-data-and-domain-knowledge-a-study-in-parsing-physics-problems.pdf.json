        "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more widely used in practice, we need new methods to build complex intelligent systems that integrate learning with existing software, and with domain knowledge encoded as rules. As a case study, we present such a system that learns to parse Newtonian physics problems in textbooks. This system, Nuts&Bolts, learns a pipeline process that incorporates existing code, pre-learned machine learning models, and human engineered rules. It jointly trains the entire pipeline to prevent propagation of errors, using a combination of labelled and unlabelled data. Our approach achieves a good performance on the parsing task, outperforming the simple pipeline and its variants. Finally, we also show how Nuts&Bolts can be used to achieve improvements on a relation extraction task and on the end task of answering Newtonian physics problems."

        "End-to-end learning is the new buzz word in machine learning.",
        "Pipelines can be tuned with small amount of labeled data and it is easier to incorporate domain knowledge expressed as rules, existing software and pre-learnt components.",
        "We model Nuts&Bolts using logic programming and show improvements over multiple baselines as well as various pipeline approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.",
        "We define a probabilistic logic program in the most general case for learning a pipeline that integrates different kinds of function approximators, domain knowledge and partial supervision.",
        "We describe the various components of the diagram parsing pipeline, pointing out the pre-learnt functions, software and rules in each stage of the pipeline.",
        "We detect low-level diagram elements using a number of pre-learnt functions and software.",
        "We again use a set of rules to map diagrams to formal language.",
        "With these variables and domain knowledge expressed as rules, we use Nuts&Bolts for learning the pipeline.",
        "The first baseline, EB proposes diagram elements using EdgeBoxes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>] and uses rules defined in Table 1 for label associations and generation of formal language.",
        "We observe pared to the various baselines in the Parsing to Programs (P2P) framework on four datasets: problems from physics textbooks (T), AP Physics C Mechanics \u2013 Section 1 that Nuts&Bolts achieves a better performance than all the practice test (P) and official tests for baselines on the challenging task of answering Newtonian physics 1998 and 2012.",
        "We can observe that the performance of our model drops even if we do not learn rule weights of our Nuts&Bolts approach showing the importance of learning.",
        "Two promising but under-explored lines of work here are [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] who propose a teacher-student network to harness logical rules and distant supervision, respectively, We mitigate the data hungriness issue by learning a pipeline \u2013 thereby making the learning process modular [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and integrating domain knowledge \u2013 yet, without incurring error propagation.",
        "A key difference in this line of work and our work is that we allow multiple function approximators in each stage in the pipeline and integration of domain knowledge in the form of rules.",
        "These usually do not incorporate: (a) multiple function approximators for each sub-task which is necessary when we have many weak learners but no one best model to do the sub-task, (b) existing software pieces as sub-task functions, (c) stage-wise supervision, and (d) semi-supervised learning.",
        "Our framework incorporates multiple function approximators for various sub-tasks, domain knowledge in the form of rules and stage-wise supervision.",
