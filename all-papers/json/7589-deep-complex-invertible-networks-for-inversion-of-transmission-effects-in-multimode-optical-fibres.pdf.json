        "abstract": "We use complex-weighted, deep networks to invert the effects of multimode optical fibre distortion of a coherent input image. We generated experimental data based on collections of optical fibre responses to greyscale input images generated with coherent light, by measuring only image amplitude (not amplitude and phase as is typical) at the output of 1 m and 10 m long, 105 \u03bcm diameter multimode fibre. This data is made available as the Optical fibre inverse problem Benchmark collection. The experimental data is used to train complex-weighted models with a range of regularisation approaches. A unitary regularisation approach for complexweighted networks is proposed which performs well in robustly inverting the fibre transmission matrix, which is compatible with the physical theory. A benefit of the unitary constraint is that it allows us to learn a forward unitary model and analytically invert it to solve the inverse problem. We demonstrate this approach, and outline how it has the potential to improve performance by incorporating knowledge of the phase shift induced by the spatial light modulator."

        "Modelling optical fibre transmission<br/><br/>The transmission of optical information by means of a guiding system has always been of paramount interest, e.g. for medical and communication systems.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that a deep network combining multiple complex dense layers with orthogonal regularisation and conventional autoencoders can successfully invert speckle images generated over a 10 m long distorted 105 \u03bcm MMF without phase information.",
        "From our knowledge of the optics, we know that the transformation of the image to speckles can be represented by a complex-valued, orthogonal transmission matrix T , but this matrix will be very large.",
        "2The field is very active, and after we submitted this paper, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBorhani_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rBorhani_et+al_2018_a\">Borhani et al, 2018</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRahmani_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rRahmani_et+al_2018_a\">Rahmani et al, 2018</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFan_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rFan_et+al_2018_a\">Fan et al, 2018</a>] published examples of deep learning encoders inferring images from the speckle patterns without an a priori model of the fibre.",
        "Our approach was to transform the speckle image back towards the original image space with a complex layer, as in Figure 4,3 followed by a denoising autoencoder which can compensate for imperfect reconstruction of the target image.",
        "As our GPU memory was insufficient to allow more than 56 \u00d7 56 transmission matrices in this more complex model, the results did not improve over the direct inverse method at the higher 112 pixel resolution.",
        "We used a multiscale approach where multiple average pooling layers after the complex dense layer fed into an output vector composed of a pyramid of halving resolutions of the target images (28 \u00d7 28, 14 \u00d7 14 and 7 \u00d7 7).",
        "Inversion was by a single complex-valued layer minimising MSE, with l2 amplitude weight regularisation.",
        "We have presented an application of deep, complex-weighted networks to create the best known results on inversion of optical fibre image with a non-scanning, interferometer-free approach to sensing.",
        "This allows direct analogue image transfer over bent optical fibre at distances not achieved before without measurement of phase information.",
        "It brings challenging requirements of non-local patches on input and the need for better models of non-local relationships between pixels if we are to be able to work with the smaller speckles associated with longer optical fibres.",
        "We achieved world-leading performance via the use of relatively simple, complex-weighted networks, which proved better than real-weighted networks in representing the inverse transmission matrix, and which can generalise to a wide range of images.",
