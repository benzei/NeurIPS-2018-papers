        "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding anomalies in high-dimensional data using popular PCA based anomaly scores. The naive algorithms for computing these scores explicitly compute the PCA of the covariance matrix which uses space quadratic in the dimensionality of the data. We give the first streaming algorithms that use space that is linear or sublinear in the dimension. We prove general results showing that any sketch of a matrix that satisfies a certain operator norm guarantee can be used to approximate these scores. We instantiate these results with powerful matrix sketching techniques such as Frequent Directions and random projections to derive efficient and practical algorithms for these problems, which we validate over real-world data sets. Our main technical contribution is to prove matrix perturbation inequalities for operators arising in the computation of these measures."

        "Pointwise guarantees with linear space: We show that any sketch Aof A with the property that AT A \u2212 A T Ais small, can be used to additively approximate the rank-k leverage scores and rank-k projection distances for each row.",
        "A matching lower bound: Can we get such an additive approximation using memory only o(d)?2 The answer is no, we show a lower bound saying that any algorithm that computes such an approximation to the rank-k leverage scores or the rank-k projection distances for all the rows of a matrix must use \u03a9(d) working space, using techniques from communication complexity.",
        "Sketches which satisfy Equation (2) can be computed in the row streaming model using random projections of the columns, subsampling the rows of the matrix proportional to their squared lengths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] or deterministically by using the Frequent Directions algorithm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
        "Any streaming algorithm which takes a constant number of passes over the data and can compute a 0.1 error additive approximation to the rank-k leverage scores or the rank-k projection distances for all the rows of a matrix must use \u03a9(d) working space.",
        "Even though the sketch gives column space approximations our goal is still to compute the row anomaly scores, so it not just a matter of working with the transpose.",
        "Our results suggest that for high dimensional data sets, it is possible to get good approximations to the exact anomaly scores even for fairly small values of (a small multiple of k), our worst-case theoretical bounds are on the pessimistic side.",
        "Our Algorithms: We run Algorithm 1 using random column projections in place of Frequent Directions.4 The relevant parameter here is the projection dimension , which results in a sketch matrix of size d \u00d7 .",
        "In contrast to these approaches, our results hold both for rank-k leverage scores and projection distances, for any matrix sketching algorithm\u2014not just FJLT or Frequent Directions\u2014and our space requirement can be as small as log(d) for average case guarantees.",
        "We show that techniques from sketching can be used to derive simple and practical algorithms for computing subspace-based anomaly scores which provably approximate the true scores at a significantly lower cost in terms of time and memory.",
        "The authors thank David Woodruff for suggestions on using communication complexity tools to show lower bounds on memory usage for approximating anomaly scores and Weihao Kong for several useful discussions on estimating singular values and vectors using random projections.",
        "A promising direction of future work is to use them in real-world high-dimensional anomaly detection tasks"
