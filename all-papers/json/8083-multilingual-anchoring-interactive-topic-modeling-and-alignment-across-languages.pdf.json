        "abstract": "Multilingual topic models can reveal patterns in cross-lingual document collections. However, existing models lack speed and interactivity, which prevents adoption in everyday corpora exploration or quick moving situations (e.g., natural disasters, political instability). First, we propose a multilingual anchoring algorithm that builds an anchor-based topic model for documents in different languages. Then, we incorporate interactivity to develop MTAnchor (Multilingual Topic Anchors), a system that allows users to refine the topic model. We test our algorithms on labeled English, Chinese, and Sinhalese documents. Within minutes, our methods can produce interpretable topics that are useful for specific classification tasks."

        "Exploring multilingual document collections<br/><br/>Modeling multilingual topics aids exploration of large corpora across languages [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
        "Finding topics in anchor-based models is fast, so it can be used in an interactive setting where users iteratively choose anchor words for every topic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
        "We propose multilingual anchoring as an algorithm to cross-lingually link topics and their corresponding anchor words.",
        "After anchor words are linked, all words in the same topic across languages will be form a coherent multilingual topic.",
        "We obtain a set of K anchor words for each language and can obtain topics using RecoverL2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
        "If there is only one anchor word for each topic, our goal of building a coherent multilingual topic model would fail.",
        "To extend the greedy approach to multilingual settings, we need anchor words that can guide topic inference in multiple languages.",
        "By choosing linked anchor words, the algorithm can align topics cross-lingually so that the aligned topics form one multilingual topic.",
        "Even if the algorithm chooses anchor words similar in meaning within the same language, interactivity can help remove duplicate topics (Section 3.2).",
        "Picking a set of anchor words for each language, multilingual anchoring follows FastAnchorWords (Section 2.1).",
        "Multilingual anchoring is an unsupervised method, but the topic distribution acts as a low-dimensional representation for each document [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
        "Multilingual anchoring uses translations to find anchor words that can lead to better topics for both languages.",
        "It uses multilingual anchoring (Section 3.1) to find sets of anchor words for each language.",
        "Users define anchors and customize the topic model to their own needs.",
        "We choose MCTA as a baseline because it is a recent work on multilingual topic models with readily available code and aligns topics using a bilingual dictionary.",
        "We train models on multilingual anchoring and MCTA with twenty topics.",
        "When the user submits final anchor words, we evaluate their topics on the test set.",
        "For English-Sinhalese LORELEI dataset, topics from multilingual anchoring are more useful for classification tasks but are less coherent than MCTA topics.",
        "A few users outperform multilingual anchoring by spending more time interacting with the model (Figure 5).",
        "MCTA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] is another generative, multilingual model, but uses dictionary entries to capture \u201ccultural-common\u201d topics.",
        "Generative methods need long documents to correctly estimate topic-word distributions, but anchoring handles documents of any size [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
