        "abstract": "We propose a data-efficient Gaussian process-based Bayesian approach to the semisupervised learning problem on graphs. The proposed model shows extremely competitive performance when compared to the state-of-the-art graph neural networks on semi-supervised learning benchmark experiments, and outperforms the neural networks in active learning experiments where labels are scarce. Furthermore, the model does not require a validation data set for early stopping to control over-fitting. Our model can be viewed as an instance of empirical distribution regression weighted locally by network connectivity. We further motivate the intuitive construction of the model with a Bayesian linear model interpretation where the node features are filtered by an operator related to the graph Laplacian. The method can be easily implemented by adapting off-the-shelf scalable variational inference algorithms for Gaussian processes."

        "Equation 12 can be viewed as the inner product between the empirical kernel mean embeddings that correspond to the bags of node features observed in the 1-hop neighborhood sub-graphs of node m and n, relating the proposed model to the Gaussian process distribution regression model presented in e.g.",
        "The alternative formulation views the GGP as a Bayesian linear model on feature maps of the nodes that have been transformed by a function related to the graph Laplacian L.",
        "Implementing the GGP with its variational inference algorithm amounts to implementing a new kernel function that follows Equation 12 in the GPflow Python package.1 We introduce a set of M inducing random variables u = [f (z1), .",
        "The GGP differs from the previously proposed GP models in that the local neighbourhood structures of the graph and the node features are directly used in the specification of the covariance function, resulting in a simple model that is highly effective.",
