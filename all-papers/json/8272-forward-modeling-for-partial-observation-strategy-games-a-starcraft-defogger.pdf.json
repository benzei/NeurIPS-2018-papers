        "abstract": "We formulate the problem of defogging as state estimation and future state prediction from previous, partial observations in the context of real-time strategy games. We propose to employ encoder-decoder neural networks for this task, and introduce proxy tasks and baselines for evaluation to assess their ability of capturing basic game rules and high-level dynamics. By combining convolutional neural networks and recurrent networks, we exploit spatial and sequential correlations and train well-performing models on a large dataset of human games of StarCraft R : Brood War R \u2020. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of our models to downstream tasks by applying them for enemy unit prediction in a state-of-the-art, rule-based StarCraft bot. We observe improvements in win rates against several strong community bots."

        "We address this question by considering the problems of state estimation and future state prediction in partially observable real-time strategy (RTS) games, taking StarCraft: Brood War as a running example",
        "The recurrent cells allow our models to capture information from previous frames, which is necessary in a partially observable environment such as StarCraft, because events that we observed minutes ago are relevant to predict the hidden parts of the current state",

        "We explored the following properties: kernel width of convolutions and striding (3,5); model depth; non-linearities (ReLU, GLU); residual connections; skip connections in the encoder LSTM; optimizers (Adam, SGD); learning rates",

        "The only deep learning approach utilizing replays of human games to improve actual full-game play is [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], which use a feed-forward model to predict the unit that the player should produce.",
        "We propose to model a low-resolution game state by considering accumulated counts of units by type, downsampled onto a coarse spatial grid.",
        "The recurrent cells allow our models to capture information from previous frames, which is necessary in a partially observable environment such as StarCraft, because events that we observed minutes ago are relevant to predict the hidden parts of the current state.",
        "We hypothesize that our models will be able to make predictions of the global build tree and local unit numbers better than strong existing baselines.",
        "We test whether we are able to use the defogger directly in a state-of-the-art rule-based StarCraft bot, and we evaluate the impact of the best models within full games.",
        "One task is the model correctly predicting the existence or absence of all enemy units on the game map, correlated to being able to model the game dynamics.",
        "To validate the strength of our models, we compare their performance to relevant baselines that are similar to what rule-based bots use traditionally in StarCraft: Brood War competitions.",
        "Well the model learns the game dynamics \u2013 in (a), the model gets almost nothing as input at the current timestep, yet still manages to predict a good distribution over the enemy units from what is seen in the previous frames.",
        "5.1.5 Evaluation in a Full-Game Bot After observing good performance on metrics representing potential downstream tasks, we test these trained models in a StarCraft: Brood War full-game setting.",
        "In Figure 3, we observe that the defogger model is able to much more precisely predict the number of units in the game compared to using heuristics, equivalent to the PS baseline.",
