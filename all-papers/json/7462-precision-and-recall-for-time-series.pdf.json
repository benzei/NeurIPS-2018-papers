        "abstract": "Classical anomaly detection is principally concerned with point-based anomalies, those anomalies that occur at a single point in time. Yet, many real-world anomalies are range-based, meaning they occur over a period of time. Motivated by this observation, we present a new mathematical model to evaluate the accuracy of time series classification algorithms. Our model expands the well-known Precision and Recall metrics to measure ranges, while simultaneously enabling customization support for domain-specific preferences."

        "NAB\u2019s Scoring Model: While focusing entirely on real-time streaming applications, the NAB authors claim that: (i) only early anomaly detection matters and only the first detection point of an anomaly range matters.",
        "When computing the recall score RecallT (Ri , P ) for a single anomaly range Ri, we consider:",
        "Before we conclude this section, it is important to note that our precision and recall formulas subsume their classical counterparts, i.e., RecallT \u2261 Recall and PrecisionT \u2261 Precision, when: (i) all Ri \u2208 R and Pj \u2208 P are represented as unit-size ranges, \u03b1 = 0, \u03b3() = 1, \u03c9() is as in Figure 2a, and \u03b4() returns flat positional bias as in Figure 2b.",
        "We present an experimental study of our range-based model applied to results of state-of-the-art AD algorithms over a collection of diverse time series datasets.",
        "Compared Scoring Models: We evaluated the prediction accuracy of each output from the anomaly detectors using three models: classical point-based precision/recall, the Numenta scoring model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], and our range-based precision/recall model.",
        "Because the narrow predictions earn similar overlap rewards as unit-size/point predictions, yet the number of predicted anomaly ranges (Np) is relatively smaller than the total number of points in those Np ranges, the value of PrecisionT comes out slightly larger than Precision for this dataset.",
        "Background on NAB\u2019s Scoring Model: While focusing entirely on real-time streaming applications, the NAB authors claim that: (i) only early anomaly detection matters and only the first detection point of an anomaly range matters.",
        "They propose a scoring model, based on anomaly windows, application profiles, and a sigmoidal scoring function, which is specifically designed to reward detections earlier in a window.",
        "We analyzed the three scoring models for their effectiveness in evaluating and comparing prediction results from multiple anomaly detectors: LSTM-AD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], Greenhouse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], and Luminol [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
        "We suppose an application that requires early detection of anomaly ranges in a non-fragmented manner, with precision and recall being important.",
        "Data indicates that this is because LSTM-AD makes a relatively smaller number of predictions clustered around the real anomaly ranges, boosting the number of TPs and making both precision and recall relatively greater.",
        "Unlike the two precision/recall models, Numenta strongly favors Luminol, even though this detector misses one of the 3 real anomaly ranges in its entirety.",
        "We implemented five alternative ways of computing recall and precision, and analyzed how the computation time for each of them scales with increasing number of real and predicted anomaly ranges.",
        "Classical precision and recall were designed for point-based data, whereas for time series data, anomalies are in the form of ranges.",
        "Future work includes designing new range-based ML techniques that are optimized for our new accuracy model"
