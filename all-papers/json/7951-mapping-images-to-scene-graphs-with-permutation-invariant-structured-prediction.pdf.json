        "abstract": "Machine understanding of complex images is a key goal of artificial intelligence. One challenge underlying this task is that visual scenes contain multiple interrelated objects, and that global context plays an important role in interpreting the scene. A natural modeling framework for capturing such effects is structured prediction, which optimizes over complex labels, while modeling within-label interactions. However, it is unclear what principles should guide the design of a structured prediction model that utilizes the power of deep learning components. Here we propose a design principle for such architectures that follows from a natural requirement of permutation invariance. We prove a necessary and sufficient characterization for architectures that follow this invariance, and discuss its implication on model design. Finally, we show that the resulting model achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Visual Genome scene-graph labeling benchmark, outperforming all recent approaches."

        "Understanding the semantics of a complex visual scene is a fundamental problem in machine perception.",
        "Structured prediction models typically define a score function s(x, y) that quantifies how well a label assignment y is compatible with an input x.",
        "Scored-based methods in structured prediction define a function s(x, y) that quantifies the degree to which y is compatible with x, and infer a label by maximizing s(x, y) [e.g., see 2, 7, 16, 20, 28].",
        "It is worthwhile to rethink the architecture of structured prediction models, and consider models that map inputs x to outputs y directly without explicitly maximizing a score function.",
        "We can view inference as a black-box that takes node-dependent and edge-dependent inputs and returns a label y, even without an explicit score function s(x, y).",
        "A graph labeling function F : (V, E) \u2192 Y is a function whose input is an ordered set of node features V = [z1, .",
        "We provide our key definition of a function whose output is invariant to permutations of the input.",
        "This results in a recurrent architecture, which we use in our scene graph model.",
        "The invariance we consider is much less restrictive: the architecture does not need to be invariant to all permutations of singleton and pairwise features, just those consistent with a graph re-labeling.",
        "NeuralMotif [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>], currently the state-of-the-art model for scene graph prediction on Visual Genome, employs an RNN that provides global context by sequentially reading the independent predictions for each entity and relation and refines those predictions.",
        "We evaluate the GPI approach on the motivating task of this paper, inferring scene graphs from images (Figure 1).",
        "The input is an image annotated with a set of bounding boxes for the entities in the image.2 The goal is to label each bounding box with the correct entity category and every pair of entities with their relation, such that they form a coherent scene graph.",
        "The network \u03b1ent takes as input the outputs of \u03c6ent for all neighbors of an entity, and uses the attention mechanism described above to output a vector of dimension n2.",
