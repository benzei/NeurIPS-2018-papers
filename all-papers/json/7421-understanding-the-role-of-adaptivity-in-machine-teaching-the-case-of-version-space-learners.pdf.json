        "abstract": "In real-world applications of education, an effective teacher adaptively chooses the next example to teach based on the learner\u2019s current state. However, most existing work in algorithmic machine teaching focuses on the batch setting, where adaptivity plays no role. In this paper, we study the case of teaching consistent, version space learners in an interactive setting. At any time step, the teacher provides an example, the learner performs an update, and the teacher observes the learner\u2019s new state. We highlight that adaptivity does not speed up the teaching process when considering existing models of version space learners, such as the \u201cworst-case\u201d model (the learner picks the next hypothesis randomly from the version space) and the \u201cpreference-based\u201d model (the learner picks hypothesis according to some global preference). Inspired by human teaching, we propose a new model where the learner picks hypotheses according to some local preference defined by the current hypothesis. We show that our model exhibits several desirable properties, e.g., adaptivity plays a key role, and the learner\u2019s transitions over hypotheses are smooth/interpretable. We develop adaptive teaching algorithms, and demonstrate our results via simulation and user studies."
