        "abstract": "Recent attempts to achieve fairness in predictive models focus on the balance between fairness and accuracy. In sensitive applications such as healthcare or criminal justice, this trade-off is often undesirable as any increase in prediction error could have devastating consequences. In this work, we argue that the fairness of predictions should be evaluated in context of the data, and that unfairness induced by inadequate samples sizes or unmeasured predictive variables should be addressed through data collection, rather than by constraining the model. We decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination into bias, variance, and noise, and propose actions aimed at estimating and reducing each term. Finally, we perform case-studies on prediction of income, mortality, and review ratings, confirming the value of this analysis. We find that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination without sacrificing accuracy."

        "When noise is significantly different between protected groups, discrimination is partially unrelated to model choice and training set size and may only be reduced by measuring additional variables.",
        "If noise is homoskedastic in regression settings, post-hoc randomization is ill-advised, as the difference in Bayes error N 0 \u2212 N 1 is zero, and discrimination is caused only by model bias or variance.",
        "We analyze the fairness properties of standard machine learning algorithms in three tasks: prediction of income based on national census data, prediction of patient mortality based on clinical notes, and prediction of book review ratings based on review text.1 We disentangle sources of discrimination by assessing the level of discrimination for the full data,estimating the value of increasing training set size by fitting Type II learning curves, and using clustering to identify subgroups where discrimination is high.",
