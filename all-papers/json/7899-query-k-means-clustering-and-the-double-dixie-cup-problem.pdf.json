Our solution shows that, under some mild assumptions on the smallest cluster size, one can obtain an (1 + )-approximation for the optimal potential with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, where"

    "summary": [
        "We extend this settings to the case where some queries to the oracle produce erroneous information, and where certain points, termed outliers, do not belong to any clusters.",
        "Unlike other semi-supervised approaches proposed for K-means clustering, we address the problem in the natural setting where the size of the smallest cluster is bounded from below by a small value dependent on the number of clusters K and the approximation constant , and where the points contain outliers.",
        "The three main differences between this line of work and ours are that we impose mild smallest cluster size constraints which significantly reduce the query complexity both in the noiseless and noisy regime, that we introduce outliers into our analysis, and that our proofs are based on a variation of the double Dixie cup problem rather than standard theoretical computer science analyses that use notions of covered and uncovered clusters.",
        "The Centroid lemma is used in conjunction with a generalization of the double Dixie cup problem to establish the stated query complexity results in the noiseless and noisy setting.",
        "The number of points to be collected is dictated by the size of the smallest cluster and the double Dixie cup coupon collector\u2019s requirements derived in the Supplement, and summarized below.",
        "The aforementioned method assumes that sampling is performed without replacement, which in our setting requires that we modify the Centroid lemma to account for sampling points uniformly at random without replacement.",
        "To establish the query complexity results in this case, we do not need to estimate the expected number of points sampled, but need instead to ensure concentration results for hypergeometric random vectors.",
        "Input: A set of n points X , the number of clusters K, a noisy oracle On with output error probability pe, a precomputed value M , and probability po of outliers.",
        "Nontrivial changes compared to the noisy query algorithm derived from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] are needed, as the presence of outliers changes the effective number of clusters.",
        "For our synthetic data experiments, we start by selecting all relevant problem parameters, the number of clusters K, the cluster imbalance \u03b1, the dimension of the point dataset d, the approximation factor and the error tolerance level \u03b4.",
        "Since the query complexity of our methods is independent from the size of the dataset, we can provide efficient solutions to large-scale crowdsourcing problems that can be formulated as K-means problems, such as is the case of image classification."
