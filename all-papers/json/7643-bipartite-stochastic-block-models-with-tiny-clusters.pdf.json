        "abstract": "We study the problem of finding clusters in random bipartite graphs. We present a simple two-step algorithm which provably finds even tiny clusters of size O(n\u03b5), where n is the number of vertices in the grap\u221ah and \u03b5 > 0. Previous algorithms were only able to identify clusters of size \u03a9( n). We evaluate the algorithm on synthetic and on real-world data; the experiments show that the algorithm can find extremely small clusters even in presence of high destructive noise."

    "summary": [
        "Finding clusters in bipartite graphs is a very fundamental problem and has many applications.",
        "They considered random bipartite graphs and proved under which conditions their algorithms can recover the ground-truth clusters.",
        "As a side result we study the setting in which the algorithm only obtains an approximate clustering of the left side of the graph.",
        "Abbe and Sandon [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] consider general SBMs. Their results can be used for bipartite graphs with overlapping communities and optimal values for p and q but they assume clusters of size \u03a9(n).",
        "We present an algorithm to recover the right clusters Vj given the left clusters Ui. The algorithm is very simple: For each cluster Ui, Vi consists of all vertices from V which have \u201cmany\u201d neighbors in Ui. We will show that the algorithm succeeds with high probability.",
        "For step (1) we use an even simpler algorithm for recovering the clusters Ui: Project the biadjacency of G on its first k left singular vectors and run k-means.",
        "On real-world graphs, this randomness resulted in different clusterings in each run of the algorithm.",
        "We will be most interested in how small p can be so that pcv can still recover clusters of size less than 10 on the right side of the graph.",
        "The parameters were set to n = 1000, k = 8, = 70, and m = \u00b7 k (i.e., 1000 vertices on the right, 8 ground-truth clusters on both sides and left-side clusters of size 70).",
        "When an algorithm was run multiple times on the same dataset, we report the best result on the right clusters of the graph.",
        "It is interesting to observe that pcv already recovers the ground-truth clusters on the right side for p \u2265 0.4 and even for p = 0.3 the results are of good quality.",
        "(g) Vary : Left Cluster Quality (h) Vary : Right Cluster Quality (i) Vary : Running times Figure 1: Results on synthetic data.",
        "We study how , the size of the left clusters Ui, influences the results of the algorithms.",
        "Pcv is the best algorithm with message delivering good results; the results of lim are of good quality for \u2265 40.",
        "It is interesting and maybe even a bit surprising that even for = 20, pcv and message can find very good clusters on the right side of the graph which only consist of 8 out of a 1000 vertices."
