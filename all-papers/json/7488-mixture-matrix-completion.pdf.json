        "abstract": "Completing a data matrix X has become an ubiquitous problem in modern data science, with motivations in recommender systems, computer vision, and networks inference, to name a few. One typical assumption is that X is low-rank. A more general model assumes that each column of X corresponds to one of several lowrank matrices. This paper generalizes these models to what we call mixture matrix completion (MMC): the case where each entry of X corresponds to one of several low-rank matrices. MMC is a more accurate model for recommender systems, and brings more flexibility to other completion and clustering problems. We make four fundamental contributions about this new model. First, we show that MMC is theoretically possible (well-posed). Second, we give its precise information-theoretic identifiability conditions. Third, we derive the sample complexity of MMC. Finally, we give a practical algorithm for MMC with performance comparable to the state-of-the-art for simpler related problems, both on synthetic and real data."

        "The columns corresponding to each subnet form a low-rank matrix, which is precisely the model assumed by HRMC.",
        "X\u03a9 contains a mixture of entries from several low-rank matrices.",
        "MMC remains challenging even if the subspaces corresponding to the low-rank matrices in the mixture are known, and even X is fully observed.",
        "If Xk is observed on more than r + 1 entries per column, it suffices that \u03a9k contains a pattern satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1.",

        "It is quite remarkable that AMMC works most of the time with as little as p \u2248 0.6, corresponding to observing \u2248 0.3 of the entries in each Xk.
