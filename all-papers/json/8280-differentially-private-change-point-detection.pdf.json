This problem appears in many important practical settings involving personal data, including biosurveillance, fault detection, finance, signal detection, and security systems. The field of differential privacy offers data analysis tools that provide powerful worst-case privacy guarantees. We study the statistical problem of change-point detection through the lens of differential privacy. We give private algorithms for both online and offline change-point detection, analyze these algorithms theoretically, and provide empirical validation of our results."

    "summary": [
        "The change-point detection problem seeks to identify distributional changes at an unknown changepoint k\u2217 in a stream of data.",
        "In offering the first algorithms for private change-point detection, we primarily use two powerful tools from the differential privacy literature.",
        "We use existing tools from differential privacy to solve the change-point detection problem in both offline and online settings, neither of which have been studied in the private setting before.",
        "We develop an offline private change-point detection algorithm OFFLINEPCPD (Algorithm 1) that is accurate under one of two assumptions about the distributions from which data are drawn.",
        "Standard -differential privacy under our first distributional assumption follows from composition of the underlying privacy mechanisms (Theorem 5).2 Accuracy of our online mechanism relies on appropriate selection of the threshold that identifies a window in which a change-point has likely occurred, at which point the error guarantees are inherited from the offline algorithm (Theorem 6).",
        "Given two hypothesized distributions P0 and P1, our algorithm OFFLINEPCPD privately approximates the MLE kof the change time k\u2217.",
        "We provide accuracy bounds for both the MLE and the output of our algorithm under two different assumptions about the distributions from which the data are drawn, summarized in Table 1.",
        "The accuracy of OFFLINEPCPD only holds under the change-point model\u2019s alternate hypothesis H1, it is -differentially private for any hypothesized distributions P0, P1 with finite \u2206( ) and privacy parameters > 0, \u03b4 = 0 regardless of the distributions from which X is drawn.",
        "We provide accuracy guarantees of the standard MLE kand the output kof our private algorithm OFFLINEPCPD when the data are drawn from P0, P1 with true change point k\u2217 \u2208 (1, n).",
        "A technical challenge that arises in proving accuracy of the private estimator is that the xi are not identically distributed when the true change-point k\u2217 \u2208 (1, n], and so the partial log-likelihood ratios",
        "A true change point k\u2217 can always be detected with perfect accuracy given xk\u2217\u22121 and xk\u2217 , so we should not expect to be able to offer any meaningful privacy guarantees for such distributions.",
        "We give a new differentially private algorithm for change point detection in the online setting, ONLINEPCPD.",
        "The misspecified change experiments bolster our theoretical results substantially, indicating that our hypotheses can be quite far from the distributions of the true data and our algorithms will still identify a change-point accurately."
