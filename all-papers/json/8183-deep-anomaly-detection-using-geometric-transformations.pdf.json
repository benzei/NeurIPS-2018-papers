        "abstract": "We consider the problem of anomaly detection in images, and present a new detection technique. Given a sample of images, all known to belong to a \u201cnormal\u201d class (e.g., dogs), we show how to train a deep neural model that can detect out-of-distribution images (i.e., non-dog objects). The main idea behind our scheme is to train a multi-class model to discriminate between dozens of geometric transformations applied on all the given images. The auxiliary expertise learned by the model generates feature detectors that effectively identify, at test time, anomalous images based on the softmax activation statistics of the model when applied on transformed images. We present extensive experiments using the proposed detector, which indicate that our technique consistently improves all known algorithms by a wide margin."

        "The well-known problem of anomaly/novelty detection highlights some of these risks, and its resolution is of the utmost importance to mission critical machine learning applications",
        "While anomaly detection has long been considered in the literature, conclusive understanding of this problem in the context of deep neural models is sorely lacking",
        "In machine vision applications, presently available novelty detection methods can suffer from poor performance in some problems, as demonstrated by our experiments",
        "The proposed method is based on the observation that learning to discriminate between many types of geometric transformations applied to normal images, encourages learning of features that are useful for detecting novelties",
        "It is very important to note that in both these variants of one-class support vector machine, we provide the one-class support vector machine with an unfair significant advantage by optimizing its hyperparameters in hindsight; i.e., the one-class support vector machine hyperparameters (\u03bd and \u03b3) were optimized to maximize AUROC and taken to be the best performing values among those in the parameter grid: \u03bd \u2208 {0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9}, \u03b3 \u2208 {2\u22127, 2\u22126, . . . , 22}",

        "We train a multi-class neural classifier over a self-labeled dataset, which is created from the normal instances and their transformed versions, obtained by applying numerous geometric transformations.",
        "This discriminative model is applied on transformed instances of the test example, and the distribution of softmax response values of the \u201cnormal\u201d train images is used for effective detection of novelties.",
        "The intuition behind our method is that by training the classifier to distinguish between transformed images, it must learn salient geometrical features, some of which are likely to be unique to the single class.",
        "We create a self-labeled dataset of images from our initial training set S, by using a class of geometric transformations T .",

        "When testing the parameters 16, 8 with our method on the CIFAR-10 dataset, anomaly detection results improved.",
        "We only utilize the transformations softmax layer output as described in section 4.2, but use the simplified normality score.",
