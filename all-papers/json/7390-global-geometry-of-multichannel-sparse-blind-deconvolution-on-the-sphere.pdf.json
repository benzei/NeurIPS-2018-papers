        "abstract": "Multichannel blind deconvolution is the problem of recovering an unknown signal f and multiple unknown channels xi from convolutional measurements yi = xi f (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ). We consider the case where the xi\u2019s are sparse, and convolution with f is invertible. Our nonconvex optimization formulation solves for a filter h on the unit sphere that produces sparse output yi h. Under some technical assumptions, we show that all local minima of the objective function correspond to the inverse filter of f up to an inherent sign and shift ambiguity, and all saddle points have strictly negative curvatures. This geometric structure allows successful recovery of f and xi using a simple manifold gradient descent algorithm with random initialization. Our theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments, which demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach over the previous methods."
