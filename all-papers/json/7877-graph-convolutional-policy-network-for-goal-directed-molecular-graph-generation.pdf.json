        "abstract": "Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while obeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and social science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goaldirected graph generation through reinforcement learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can achieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the constrained property optimization task."

        "GCPN predicts the action of the bond addition, and is trained via policy gradient to optimize a reward composed of molecular property objectives and adversarial loss.",

        "We start with a graph containing a single atom, traverse all valid actions given the current state, randomly pick the state with top 5 highest property score as long as there is improvement over the current state, and loop until reaching the maximum number of nodes.",
        "Most generated molecules are realistic, in some very rare cases, especially where we reduce the of the adversarial reward and expert pretraining components, our method can generate undesirable molecules with astonishingly high penalized logP predicted by the empirical model, such as the one on the bottom-right of Figure 2(a) in which our method correctly identified that Iodine has the highest per atom contribution in the empirical model used to calculate logP.",
        "Note that the hill climbing baseline algorithm mostly generates undesirable cases where the accuracy of the empirical prediction model is questionable, its performance with optimizing penalized logP is not listed on Table 1.",
        "GCPN is able to generate molecules with high diversity, indicating that it is capable of learning a general stochastic policy to generate molecular graphs that fulfill the property requirements.",
        "We train a fixed GCPN in an environment whose initial state is randomly set to be one of the 800 ZINC molecules, conduct the same training procedure as the property optimization task.",
