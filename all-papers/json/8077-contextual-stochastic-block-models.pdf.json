        "abstract": "We provide the first information theoretic tight analysis for inference of latent community structure given a sparse graph along with high dimensional node covariates, correlated with the same latent communities. Our work bridges recent theoretical breakthroughs in the detection of latent community structure without nodes covariates and a large body of empirical work using diverse heuristics for combining node covariates with graphs for inference. The tightness of our analysis implies in particular, the information theoretical necessity of combining the different sources of information. Our analysis holds for networks of large degrees as well as for a Gaussian version of the model."

        "Data clustering is a widely used primitive in exploratory data analysis and summarization.",
        "(Technically, we will assume that A and B are conditionally independent given the node labels.) We argue that in almost all practical graph clustering problems, feature representations provide complementary information of the latent clustering.",
        "We introduce a simple statistical model of complementary graph and high-dimensional covariate data that share latent cluster structure.",
        "This work focused on the sparse setting where the graph as O(n) edges and conjectured, using the non-rigorous cavity method, the following phase transition phenomenon.",
        "Given the graph G, it is possible to non-trivially estimate the latent clustering v if, and only if, \u03bb > 1.",
        "Theorems 1 and 2 confirm the cavity prediction rigorously in the corner cases, in which either \u03bb or \u03bc vanishes, using intricate tools from random matrix theory and sparse random graphs.",
        "For the Gaussian observation model (8), (9) we can establish a precise weak recovery threshold, which is the main technical novelty of this paper.",
        "In terms of rigorous results, [AJC14, LMX15] introduced and analyzed a model with informative edges, but they make the strong and unrealistic requirement that the label of individual edges and each of their endpoints are uncorrelated and are only able to prove one side of their conjectured threshold.",
        "Note that this is in stark contrast to Theorem 4 above, which posits that given high dimensional covariate information shifts the information theoretic threshold for detection and weak recovery.",
        "The behavior of this iterative algorithm, in the limit p, n \u2192 \u221e can be tracked using a distributional recursion called density evolution.",
        "Under the density evolution mapping, we obtain the random variables (\u03b7 , m ) = DE(\u03b7, m Let m and m denote the vector of the first two moments of (\u03b7, V, m , U ) and (\u03b7 , V , m , U ) defined as follows: m = (E{V \u03b7}, E{U m }, E{\u03b72}, E{m 2}) , (23)",
        "A key step of our analysis is provided by Theorem 6, which establishes a weak recovery threshold for the Gaussian observation model of Eqs.",
        "In order to prove that weak recovery is possible for \u03bb2 + \u03bc2/\u03b3 > 1, we consider the following optimization problem over x \u2208 Rn, y \u2208 Rp: maximize x, Ax + b\u2217 x, By , (26)"
