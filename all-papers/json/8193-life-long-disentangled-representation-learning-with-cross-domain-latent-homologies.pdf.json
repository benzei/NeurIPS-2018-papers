        "abstract": "Intelligent behaviour in the real-world requires the ability to acquire new knowledge from an ongoing sequence of experiences while preserving and reusing past knowledge. We propose a novel algorithm for unsupervised representation learning from piece-wise stationary visual data: Variational Autoencoder with Shared Embeddings (VASE). Based on the Minimum Description Length principle, VASE automatically detects shifts in the data distribution and allocates spare representational capacity to new knowledge, while simultaneously protecting previously learnt representations from catastrophic forgetting. Our approach encourages the learnt representations to be disentangled, which imparts a number of desirable properties: VASE can deal sensibly with ambiguous inputs, it can enhance its own representations through imagination-based exploration, and most importantly, it exhibits semantically meaningful sharing of latents between different datasets. Compared to baselines with entangled representations, our approach is able to reason beyond surface-level statistics and perform semantically meaningful cross-domain inference."

        "We demonstrate that the pressure to disentangle endows VASE with a number of useful properties: 1) dealing sensibly with ambiguous inputs; 2) learning richer representations through imagination-based exploration; 3) performing semantically meaningful cross-domain inference by ignoring irrelevant aspects of surface-level appearance.",
        "It was shown that optimising the -VAE objective helps with learning a more semantically meaningful disentangled representation q(z|x) of the data generative factors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
        "We have to ensure that the subset of the relevant generative factors zs inferred for the current data xs according to section 3.3 matches that of the candidate past dataset t.",
        "We initialise the latent representation z to have at least as many dimensions as the total number of the data generative factors |z| |Z| = N , and the softmax layer of the auxiliary environment classifier to be at least as large as the number of datasets |S| = K.",
        "During training we expect VASE to detect shifts in the data distribution and dynamically create new experience clusters s, learn a disentangled representation of each environment without forgetting past environments, and share disentangled factors between environments in a semantically meaningful way.",
        "Good accuracy on these measures would indicate that at the point of measurement, the latent representation z contained dataset relevant information, and could be useful, e.g. for subsequent policy learning in RL agents.",
        "Figure 2 shows that both VASE and CCI-VAE learn progressively more informative latent representations when exposed to each dataset s, as evidenced by the increasing classification accuracy and decreasing mean squared error (MSE) measures within each stage of training.",
        "Ablation study Here we perform a full ablation study to test the importance of the proposed components for unsupervised life-long representation learning: 1) regularisation towards disentangled representations, 2) latent masking, 3) environment clustering, and 4) \u201cdreaming\u201d feedback loop.",
        "Semantic transfer Here we test whether VASE can learn more sophisticated cross-domain latent homologies than the positional latents on the moving MNIST and Fashion datasets described above.",
        "Figure 4B demonstrates that VASE learns to share semantically meaningful factors in the more challenging 5-dataset cross-domain reconstruction task.",
