Given a causal Bayesian network M on a graph with n discrete variables and bounded in-degree and bounded \u201cconfounded components\u201d, we show that O(log n) interventions on an unknown causal Bayesian network X on the same graph, and O(n/ 2) samples per intervention, suffice to efficiently distinguish whether X = M or whether there exists some intervention under which X and M are farther than in total variation distance. We also obtain sample/time/intervention efficient algorithms for: (i) testing the identity of two unknown causal Bayesian networks on the same graph; and (ii) learning a causal Bayesian network on a given graph. Although our algorithms are non-adaptive, we show that adaptivity does not help in general: \u03a9(log n) interventions are necessary for testing the identity of two unknown causal Bayesian networks on the same graph, even adaptively. Our algorithms are enabled by a new subadditivity inequality for the squared Hellinger distance between two causal Bayesian networks."

        "We can use our techniques to extend Theorem 1 in several ways: (1) In the two-sample testing problem for causal models, the tester gets access to two unknown causal models X and Y on the same set of variables V \u222a U.",
        "We show an algorithm to solve C2ST(G, ) that makes O interventions on the input models X and Y, uses O(n/ 2) samples per intervention and runs in time O(n2/ 2), when G has bounded in-degree and c-component size.6 (2) For the C2ST(G, ) problem, the requirement that G be fully known is rather strict.",
        "Given a DAG G with bounded in-degree and c-component size and a parameter > 0, we design an algorithm that on getting access to a CBN X defined over G, makes O interventions, uses O(n2/ 4) samples per intervention, runs in time O(n3/ 4), and returns an oracle N that can efficiently compute PX [V \\ T | do(T = t)] for any T \u2286 V and t \u2208 \u03a3|T| with error at most in TV distance.",
        "There exists a causal graph G on n vertices, with maximum in-degree at most d and largest c-component size at most , such that \u03a9(|\u03a3| d\u22122 log n) interventions are necessary for any algorithm that solves C2ST(G, ) or CL(G, ), where \u03a3 is the alphabet set from which the variables take values.",
