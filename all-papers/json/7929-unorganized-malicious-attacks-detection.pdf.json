        "abstract": "Recommender systems have attracted much attention during the past decade. Many attack detection algorithms have been developed for better recommendations, mostly focusing on shilling attacks, where an attack organizer produces a large number of user profiles by the same strategy to promote or demote an item. This work considers another different attack style: unorganized malicious attacks, where attackers individually utilize a small number of user profiles to attack different items without organizer. This attack style occurs in many real applications, yet relevant study remains open. We formulate the unorganized malicious attacks detection as a matrix completion problem, and propose the Unorganized Malicious Attacks detection (UMA) algorithm, based on the alternating splitting augmented Lagrangian method. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
