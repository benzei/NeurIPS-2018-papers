        "abstract": "Time series are ubiquitous in many classification/regression applications. However, the time series data in real applications may contain many missing values. Hence, given multiple (possibly correlated) time series data, it is important to fill in missing values and at the same time to predict their class labels. Existing imputation methods often impose strong assumptions of the underlying data generating process, such as linear dynamics in the state space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called BRITS, based on recurrent neural networks for missing value imputation in time series data. Our proposed method directly learns the missing values in a bidirectional recurrent dynamical system, without any specific assumption. The imputed values are treated as variables of RNN graph and can be effectively updated during backpropagation. BRITS has three advantages: (a) it can handle multiple correlated missing values in time series; (b) it generalizes to time series with nonlinear dynamics underlying; (c) it provides a data-driven imputation procedure and applies to general settings with missing data. We evaluate our model on three real-world datasets, including an air quality dataset, a healthcare dataset, and a localization dataset for human activity. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both imputation and classification/regression."
