        "abstract": "Bayesian Optimisation (BO) refers to a class of methods for global optimisation of a function f which is only accessible via point evaluations. It is typically used in settings where f is expensive to evaluate. A common use case for BO in machine learning is model selection, where it is not possible to analytically model the generalisation performance of a statistical model, and we resort to noisy and expensive training and validation procedures to choose the best model. Conventional BO methods have focused on Euclidean and categorical domains, which, in the context of model selection, only permits tuning scalar hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. However, with the surge of interest in deep learning, there is an increasing demand to tune neural network architectures. In this work, we develop NASBOT, a Gaussian process based BO framework for neural architecture search. To accomplish this, we develop a distance metric in the space of neural network architectures which can be computed efficiently via an optimal transport program. This distance might be of independent interest to the deep learning community as it may find applications outside of BO. We demonstrate that NASBOT outperforms other alternatives for architecture search in several cross validation based model selection tasks on multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks."

    "summary": [
        "In many real world problems, we are required to sequentially evaluate a noisy black-box function f with the goal of finding its optimum in some domain X.",
        "None of the above methods have been designed with a focus on the expense of evaluating a neural network, with an emphasis on being judicious in selecting which architecture to try .",
        "Our goal is to maximise a function f defined on a space X of neural network architectures.",
        "A neural network G = (L, E) is defined by a set of layers L and directed edges E.",
        "Note that the performance of a neural network is determined by the amount of computation at each layer, the types of these operations, and how the layers are connected.",
        "We first describe two concepts, layer masses and path lengths, which we will use to define OTMANN.",
        "We use m = m = \u03b6 u\u2208PL m(u) where PL denotes the set of processing layers, and \u03b6 \u2208 (0, 1) is a parameter to be determined.",
        "As the layers of a neural network can be topologically ordered1, the above path lengths are well defined and finite.",
        "Structural penalty \u03c6str: We define a matrix Cstr \u2208 Rn1\u00d7n2 where Cstr(i, j) is small if layers i \u2208 L1 and j \u2208 L2 are at structurally similar positions in their respective networks.",
        "We define \u03c6str in terms of the shortest/longest/random-walk path lengths from/to the input/output, because they capture various notions of information flow in a neural network; a layer\u2019s input is influenced by the paths the data takes before reaching the layer and its output influences all layers it passes through before reaching the decision layers.",
        "While there has been prior work for defining various distances and kernels on graphs, we cannot use them in BO because neural networks have additional complex properties in addition to graphical structure, such as the type of operations performed at each layer, the number of neurons, etc.",
        "While EA works fine for cheap functions, such as the acquisition \u03c6t which is analytically available, it is not suitable when evaluations are expensive, such as training a neural network.",
        "Our RAND implementation, operates in exactly the same way as NASBOT, except that the EA procedure is fed a random sample from Unif(0, 1) instead of the GP acquisition each time it evaluates an architecture.",
        "A key contribution of this work is the efficiently computable OTMANN distance for neural network architectures, which may be of independent interest as it might find applications outside of BO.",
