        "abstract": "We introduce a family of implicit probabilistic integrators for initial value problems (IVPs), taking as a starting point the multistep Adams\u2013Moulton method. The implicit construction allows for dynamic feedback from the forthcoming timestep, in contrast to previous probabilistic integrators, all of which are based on explicit methods. We begin with a concise survey of the rapidly-expanding field of probabilistic ODE solvers. We then introduce our method, which builds on and adapts the work of Conrad et al. (2016) and Teymur et al. (2016), and provide a rigorous proof of its well-definedness and convergence. We discuss the problem of the calibration of such integrators and suggest one approach. We give an illustrative example highlighting the effect of the use of probabilistic integrators\u2014including our new method\u2014in the setting of parameter inference within an inverse problem."

        "Note that all distributions in this framework are Gaussian, to permit fast filtering, and as a result the non-linearities in f are effectively linearised, and any numerical method which produces non-Gaussian errors has Gaussians fitted to them anyway.",

        "We note that this procedure is merely to facilitate straightforward sampling\u2014though r(z) is linear in z, the inclusion of the first additional term from the Taylor expansion means that information about the non-linearity of f are still incorporated to second order, and the generated solution Z is not jointly Gaussian across time steps i.",
