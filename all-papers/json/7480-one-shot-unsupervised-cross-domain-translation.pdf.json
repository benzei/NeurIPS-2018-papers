        "abstract": "Given a single image x from domain A and a set of images from domain B, our task is to generate the analogous of x in B. We argue that this task could be a key AI capability that underlines the ability of cognitive agents to act in the world and present empirical evidence that the existing unsupervised domain translation methods fail on this task. Our method follows a two step process. First, a variational autoencoder for domain B is trained. Then, given the new sample x, we create a variational autoencoder for domain A by adapting the layers that are close to the image in order to directly fit x, and only indirectly adapt the other layers. Our experiments indicate that the new method does as well, when trained on one sample x, as the existing domain transfer methods, when these enjoy a multitude of training samples from domain A. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/sagiebenaim/OneShotTranslation."

    "summary": [
        "A simplification of an intuitive paradigm for accumulating knowledge by an intelligent agent is as follows.",
        "The samples from domain B continue to train its own copy as in the first step, updating both the shared and the unshared layers.",
        "This way, the autoencoder of B is adjusted by x through the loss incurred on unshared layers for domain B by the circularity loss, and through subsequent adaptation of the shared layers to fit the samples of B.",
        "In order to translate a sample x in domain A to domain B, one employs the encoder of A and the decoder of B, i.e., TAB = GB \u25e6 EA.",
        "Denote by P (x) the set of random augmentations of x and the cross-domain encoding/decoding as: TBB =GBU (GS(ES(EBU (x))))",
        "Namely, the reconstruction loss on x, a one-way cycle loss applied to x, and the generator and discriminator losses for domain B given the source sample x.",
        "This happens indirectly: during training the unshared layers of EBU and GUB are updated via the one-shot cycle loss (Eq 11).",
        "Its aim is to adapt the unshared layers of domain A to the shared representation obtained based on the samples of domain B.",
        "Updating the layers of GS and ES based on loss LII, would quickly lead to overfitting on x, since for every shared representation, the unshared layers in domain A can still reconstruct this one sample.",
        "If we had the cycle-loss in the reverse direction, all SVHN images would be translated to the single MNIST image present in training.",
        "We compare OST, trained on a single sample x \u2208 A, to both UNIT and CycleGAN trained either on x alone or with the entire training set of images from A.",
        "We further evaluate our approach, when more samples are presented, showing that OST is able to perform well on larger training sets.",
        "Selective back propagation is lifted, and gradients from losses of LII are passed through shared encoders and decoders, Es and Gs. The results are reported in Tab. 1.",
        "Tab. 3 shows that OST achieves a similar perceptual distance and style difference to CycleGAN and UNIT trained on the entire training set.",
        "This indicates that OST achieves a similar content similarity to the input image, and style difference to the target domain, as these methods.",
        "An analog two phase approach can be attempted, in which an autoencoder is trained on the source domain, replicated, and tuned selectively on the target domain."
