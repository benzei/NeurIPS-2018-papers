        "abstract": "We propose Lomax delegate racing (LDR) to explicitly model the mechanism of survival under competing risks and to interpret how the covariates accelerate or decelerate the time to event. LDR explains non-monotonic covariate effects by racing a potentially infinite number of sub-risks, and consequently relaxes the ubiquitous proportional-hazards assumption which may be too restrictive. Moreover, LDR is naturally able to model not only censoring, but also missing event times or event types. For inference, we develop a Gibbs sampler under data augmentation for moderately sized data, along with a stochastic gradient descent maximum a posteriori inference algorithm for big data applications. Illustrative experiments are provided on both synthetic and real datasets, and comparison with various benchmark algorithms for survival analysis with competing risks demonstrates distinguished performance of LDR."

        "This clear restriction motivates us to generalize exponential racing to Lomax racing, which can have a time-varying hazard rate for each competing risk, and further to Lomax delegate racing, which can use the convolution of a potentially countably infinite number of covariate-dependent gamma distributions to model each \u03bbj.",
        "As shown in the following Corollary, LDR can be considered as a generalization of exponential racing, where the exponential rate parameter of each competing risk j is a weighted summation of a countably infinite number of gamma random variables with covariate-dependent weights.",

        "For data 1 where the survival times under both risks depend on the covariates monotonically, LDR has comparable performance with Cox, FG, and BST, and all these four models slightly outperform RF in terms of the mean values of C-indices.",

        "LDR models the survival times under risks as a two-phase race of sub-risks, which not only intuitively explains the mechanism of surviving under competing risks, but helps model non-monotonic covariate effects.",
        "We use the gamma process to support a potentially countably infinite number of sub-risks for each risk, and rely on its inherent shrinkage mechanism to remove unneeded model capacity, making LDR be capable of detecting unknown event subtypes without pre-specifying their numbers."
