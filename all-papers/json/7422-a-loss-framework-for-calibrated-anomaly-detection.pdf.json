        "abstract": "Given samples from a distribution, anomaly detection is the problem of determining if a given point lies in a low-density region. This paper concerns calibrated anomaly detection, which is the practically relevant extension where we additionally wish to produce a confidence score for a point being anomalous. Building on a classification framework for standard anomaly detection, we show how minimisation of a suitable proper loss produces density estimates only for anomalous instances. These are shown to naturally relate to the pinball loss, which provides implicit quantile control. Finally, leveraging a result from point processes, we show how to efficiently optimise a special case of the objective with kernelised scores. Our framework is shown to incorporate a close relative of the one-class SVM as a special case."

        "Modelling only the tail of the density via (4) requires moving beyond strictly proper composite losses: from Proposition 2, all such losses have the same Bayes-optimal solution, up to a transformation.",
        "This weight corresponds to the cost-sensitive loss Proposition 1 estimates the \u03b1th density sublevel set.",
        "4.2 Partial density estimation via c\u03b1-strictly proper losses",
        "The scores should approximately preserve the density ordering, owing to the relation between proper loss minimisation and ranking [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAgarwal_2013_a\" href=\"#rAgarwal_2013_a\">Agarwal, 2013</a>]; this suffices for the empirical p-value per (3).",
        "The lossof (14) yields Bayes-optimal solutions suitable for density sublevel set estimation, but at price: in general, the loss will be non-convex.",
        "This idea can be generalised to any partially capped loss (17) that builds on some strictly proper composite .5 Concretely, we take such a loss with parameter \u03c1 and construct the modified risk",
        "Remark 13: We can use the above trick to ease optimisation for density sublevel set estimation, when employing (\u22121, v) = 1/2 \u00b7 v2 or its cost-weighted version.",
        "Our framework offers a different perspective on the individual ingredients in a OC-SVM style objective: the hinge loss arises from capping a linear loss (+1, \u00b7), so as to compute tail density estimates; the term linear in \u03c1 arises from re-expressing the hinge loss in terms of the pinball loss; and the regulariser arises from absorbing a model penalty plus a squared loss on the background distribution.",
