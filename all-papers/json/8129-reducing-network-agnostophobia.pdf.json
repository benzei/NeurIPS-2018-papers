        "abstract": "Agnostophobia, the fear of the unknown, can be experienced by deep learning engineers while applying their networks to real-world applications. Unfortunately, network behavior is not well defined for inputs far from a networks training set. In an uncontrolled environment, networks face many instances that are not of interest to them and have to be rejected in order to avoid a false positive. This problem has previously been tackled by researchers by either a) thresholding softmax, which by construction cannot return none of the known classes, or b) using an additional background or garbage class. In this paper, we show that both of these approaches help, but are generally insufficient when previously unseen classes are encountered. We also introduce a new evaluation metric that focuses on comparing the performance of multiple approaches in scenarios where such unseen classes or unknowns are encountered. Our major contributions are simple yet effective Entropic Open-Set and Objectosphere losses that train networks using negative samples from some classes. These novel losses are designed to maximize entropy for unknown inputs while increasing separation in deep feature space by modifying magnitudes of known and unknown samples. Experiments on networks trained to classify classes from MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that our novel loss functions are significantly better at dealing with unknown inputs from datasets such as Devanagari, NotMNIST, CIFAR-100 and SVHN."

        "We want to exploit and exaggerate this property to develop a network where for x \u2208 Db we reduce the deep feature magnitude ( F (x) ) and maximize entropy of the softmax scores in order to separate them from known samples.",
        "While we keep the softmax loss calculation untouched for samples of Dc, we modify it for training with the samples from Db seeking to equalize their logit values lc, which will result in equal softmax scores Sc. The intuition here is that if an input is unknown, we know nothing about what classes it relates to or what features we want it to have and, we want the maximum entropy distribution of uniform probabilities over the known classes.",
        "The Entropic Open-Set loss produces a network that generally represents the unknown samples with very low magnitudes, while producing high softmax entropy.",

        "For networks whose logit layer does not have bias terms, given an known unknown input x \u2208 Db, the loss JR(x) is minimized if and only if the deep feature vector F = 0, which in turn ensures the softmax responses",
        "The CCR is identical to the closed-set classification accuracy on Dc. Unlike the above discussed evaluation measures, which are prone to dataset bias, OSCR is not since its DIR axis is computed solely from samples belonging to Dc. when algorithms exposed to different number of samples from Da need to be compared, rather than using the normalized FPR with an algorithm specific Da, we may use the raw number of false positives on the horizontal axis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].",
