        "abstract": "We present a convolutional network that is equivariant to rigid body motions. The model uses scalar-, vector-, and tensor fields over 3D Euclidean space to represent data, and equivariant convolutions to map between such representations. These SE(3)-equivariant convolutions utilize kernels which are parameterized as a linear combination of a complete steerable kernel basis, which is derived analytically in this paper. We prove that equivariant convolutions are the most general equivariant linear maps between fields over R3. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of 3D Steerable CNNs for the problem of amino acid propensity prediction and protein structure classification, both of which have inherent SE(3) symmetry."

    "summary": [
        "Machine learning techniques are being applied in the natural sciences.",
        "The convolution kernel is modeled as a tensor field satisfying an equivariance constraint, from which steerable filters arise automatically.",
        "The class of regular G-CNNs represents the input signal in terms of scalar fields on a group G (e.g. SE(3)) or homogeneous space G/H (e.g. R3 = SE(3)/ SO(3)) and maps between feature spaces of consecutive layers via group convolutions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>].",
        "The second difference is that whereas the TFN and NBN use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to parameterize the network, we parameterize the convolution kernel as a linear combination of steerable basis filters.",
        "The harmonic network and 3D steerable CNN use features that transform under irreducible representations of SO(2) resp.",
        "Our general approach to building SE(3)-equivariant networks will be as follows: First, we will specify for each layer n a linear transformation law \u03c0n(g) : Fn \u2192 Fn, which describes how the feature space Fn transforms under transformations of the input by g \u2208 SE(3).",
        "A linear map from Fn to Fn+1 is equivariant if and only if it is a cross-correlation with a rotation-steerable kernel.",
        "By mapping each \u03b7jl,Jm back to the original basis via QT and unvectorizing, we obtain a basis \u03bajl,Jm for the space of equivariant kernels between features of order j and l.",
        "For each non-scalar irreducible feature \u03bani fn\u22121(x) = fni (x) \u2208 R2lin+1 in layer n, we produce a scalar gate \u03c3), where \u03c3 denotes the sigmoid function and \u03b3ni is another learnable rotation-steerable kernel.",
        "In a computer implementation of SE(3) equivariant networks, we need to sample both the fields / feature maps and the kernel on a discrete sampling grid in Z3.",
        "Once the network is trained, we can convert the network to a standard 3D CNN by linearly combining the basis kernels with the learned weights, and storing only the resulting filter bank.",
        "In this paper we have presented 3D Steerable CNNs, a class of SE(3)-equivariant networks which represents data in terms of various kinds of fields over R3.",
        "We have presented a comprehensive theory of 3D Steerable CNNs, and have proven that convolutions with SO(3)-steerable filters provide the most general way of mapping between fields in an equivariant manner, establishing SE(3)equivariant networks as a universal class of architectures.",
