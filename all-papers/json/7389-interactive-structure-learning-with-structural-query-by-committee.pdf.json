    "summary": [
        "We introduce interactive structure learning, an abstract problem that encompasses many interactive learning tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation, including active learning of binary classifiers, interactive clustering, interactive embedding, and active learning of structured output predictors.",
        "It is a generalization of the well-known query-bycommittee (QBC) algorithm [33, 16], and operates, roughly, by maintaining a posterior distribution over structures and soliciting feedback on snapshots on which there is high uncertainty.",
        "The feedback at time t is the answer y to some atomic question a 2 A, and we t can define the resulting version space to be {g 2 G g a 0 y for all t0",
        "The probability that a particular query q 2 Q is chosen in round t by structural QBC is proportional to \u232b q u q \u21e1 ()(; t",
        "To formally specify this setting, let Y be the space of answers to atomic questions A, and suppose that structures in G generate values in some prediction space Z \u2713 Rd. That is, each g 2 G is a function g : A !",
        "In the 0-1 loss setting, structural QBC chooses queries proportional to their uncertainty.",
        "What queries will structural QBC make in the general loss setting?",
        "Note that the random outcomes during time step t of structural QBC consist of the query q , the atomic question a t t that the expert chooses to answer, and the response y to a .",
        "The following lemma, whose proof is deferred to the appendix, demonstrates that under Assumption 1, the posterior probability of g\u21e4 increases in expectation with each query, as long as the parameter of the update rule in equation (1) is small enough relative to .",
        "First, to ensure that the queries q t capture some portion of the uncertainty in the current posterior, and second, that the user chooses atoms that are at least slightly informative.",
        "With these assumptions in place, the following theorem guarantees the consistency of structural QBC under general losses.",
        "Suppose we are in the general loss setting, is finite, and the user\u2019s feedback satisfies",
        "We showed that structural QBC remains consistent in this setting, albeit under different noise conditions.",
        "On the interactive clustering side, these experiments demonstrate that even when the prior distribution places relatively low mass on the target clustering, structural QBC is capable of recovering a lowerror clustering with relatively few rounds of interaction.",
        "On the active learning side, there are experiments demonstrating the good empirical performance of structural QBC using linear classifiers with the squared-loss posterior update, with and without kernelization."
