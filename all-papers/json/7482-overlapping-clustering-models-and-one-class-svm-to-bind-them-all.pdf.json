        "abstract": "People belong to multiple communities, words belong to multiple topics, and books cover multiple genres; overlapping clusters are commonplace. Many existing overlapping clustering methods model each person (or word, or book) as a non-negative weighted combination of \u201cexemplars\u201d who belong solely to one community, with some small noise. Geometrically, each person is a point on a cone whose corners are these exemplars. This basic form encompasses the widely used Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel of networks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] and its degree-corrected variants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], as well as topic models such as LDA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. We show that a simple one-class SVM yields provably consistent parameter inference for all such models, and scales to large datasets. Experimental results on several simulated and real datasets show our algorithm (called SVM-cone) is both accurate and scalable."

        "We show that if the row-wise error of R is small, the SVM approach can be used to infer G from empirical cones.",
        "We show that since the row-wise error of R is small for different degree-corrected overlapping network models and topic models, we can use our algorithm to infer the parameters consistently.",
        "Our key insight is that under certain conditions, the ideal cone problem can be solved by a one-class SVM applied to the rows of Y.",
        "Unlike the ideal cone scenario, the rows Y P corresponding to the corners need not be support vectors for the empirical cone.",
        "We show that every point i that is close to the supporting hyperplane is nearly a corner of the ideal cone.",
        "We have already shown that in such cases, the eigenvector matrix V forms an ideal cone (Lemma 2.1), and that Condition 1 holds.",
        "The theorem shows that SVM-cone can be used to consistently infer the parameters of DCMMSB as well as OCCAM [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].",
