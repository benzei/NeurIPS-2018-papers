        "abstract": "Novelty detection is the problem of identifying whether a new data point is considered to be an inlier or an outlier. We assume that training data is available to describe only the inlier distribution. Recent approaches primarily leverage deep encoder-decoder network architectures to compute a reconstruction error that is used to either compute a novelty score or to train a one-class classifier. While we too leverage a novel network of that kind, we take a probabilistic approach and effectively compute how likely it is that a sample was generated by the inlier distribution. We achieve this with two main contributions. First, we make the computation of the novelty probability feasible because we linearize the parameterized manifold capturing the underlying structure of the inlier distribution, and show how the probability factorizes and can be computed with respect to local coordinates of the manifold tangent space. Second, we improve the training of the autoencoder network. An extensive set of results show that the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets."

        "Novelty detection is the problem of identifying whether a new data point is considered to be an inlier or an outlier.",
        "We show that this approach allows us to effectively use the decoder network to learn the parameterized manifold shaping the inlier distribution, in conjunction with the probability distribution of the latent space.",
        "We named the approach generative probabilistic novelty detection (GPND) because we compute the probability distribution of the full model, which includes the signal plus noise portion, and because it relies on being able to generate data samples.",
        "Deep learning based approaches have used neural networks and leveraged the reconstruction error of encoder-decoder architectures.",
        "The proposed approach relates to the statistical methods because it aims at computing the probability distribution of test samples as novelty score, but it does so by learning the manifold structure of the distribution with an encoder-decoder network.",
        "It is not suitable for image compression, and while its generative nature allows in principle to produce novel images, in this work we focus only on novelty detection by evaluating the inlier probability distribution on test samples.",
        "We use an adversarial loss for matching the distribution of the decoded images from z and the known, training data distribution.",
        "After learning the encoder and decoder networks, by mapping the training set onto the latent space through g, we fit to the data a generalized Gaussian distribution and estimate pZ(z).",
        "For each class of digit, we train the proposed model and simulate outliers as randomly sampled images from other categories with proportion from 10% to 50%.",
        "Results reported in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] correspond to not splitting data into separate training, validation and testing sets, because it is not essential, since they leverage a VGG [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>] network pretrained on ImageNet [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>].",
        "The baselines are: i) vanilla AE with thresholding of the reconstruction error and same pipeline (AE); ii) proposed approach where the AAE is replaced by a VAE (P-VAE); iii) proposed approach where the AAE is without the additional adversarial component induced by the discriminator applied to the decoded image (P-AAE).",
        "We introduced GPND, an approach and a network architecture for novelty detection that is based on learning mappings f and g that define the parameterized manifold M which captures the underlying structure of the inlier distribution.",
        "Unlike prior deep learning based methods, GPND detects that a given sample is an outlier by evaluating its inlier probability distribution.",
        "With a relatively simple architecture we have shown how GPND provides state-of-the-art performance using different measures, different datasets, and different protocols, demonstrating to compare favorably with the out-of-distribution literature."
