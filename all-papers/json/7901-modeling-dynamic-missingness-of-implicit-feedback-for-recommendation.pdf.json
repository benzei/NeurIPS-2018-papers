        "abstract": "Implicit feedback is widely used in collaborative filtering methods for recommendation. It is well known that implicit feedback contains a large number of values that are missing not at random (MNAR); and the missing data is a mixture of negative and unknown feedback, making it difficult to learn users\u2019 negative preferences. Recent studies modeled exposure, a latent missingness variable which indicates whether an item is exposed to a user, to give each missing entry a confidence of being negative feedback. However, these studies use static models and ignore the information in temporal dependencies among items, which seems to be an essential underlying factor to subsequent missingness. To model and exploit the dynamics of missingness, we propose a latent variable named \u201cuser intent\u201d to govern the temporal changes of item missingness, and a hidden Markov model to represent such a process. The resulting framework captures the dynamic item missingness and incorporate it into matrix factorization (MF) for recommendation. We also explore two types of constraints to achieve a more compact and interpretable representation of user intents. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art recommender systems."

        "Collaborative filtering methods based on implicit feedback are widely used in recommender systems.",
        "They make predictions in two steps: They first model exposure variables for each user to get the candidate items that are not missing and recommend top-ranked items in the set of candidate items based on user preferences.",
        "In this paper we assume user preferences are static and focus on modeling the dynamic missingness for the MNAR problem.",
        "We choose HMM for user intent because HMM can well utilize the temporal data to mine the asymmetric item dependencies; and the latent states can be shared by all users, which simplifies the structure of the missingness mechanism.",
        "We define two kinds of constraints, namely inner constraint and outer constraint, to specialize the Beta priors of missingness variables of different items under different user intents.",
        "We use the inner constraint to denote the influences from other items under the same user intent to one item\u2019s missingness.",
        "We use the outer constraint to denote the influences from the same item under different user intents to one item\u2019s missingness.",
        "We describe the used datasets and experimental settings, evaluate the performance results, and analyze the user intent and the item constraints.",
        "Note that PMF, WMF, ExpoMF, and H4MF model user preference : they all use a basic matrix factorization method and the main difference is the way they model the missing data.",
        "ExpoMF models exposure variable \u03b1ui for every user-item pair so it can capture more information from the missing data compared to WMF and PMF.",
        "We use the term \u201crecommendation overlap\u201d to denote the ratio of common items in Top-N recommendation lists generated by two different user intents.",
        "A large recommendation overlap indicates that the two user intents have similar missingness mechanisms.",
        "We can see the recommendation overlaps of H4MFc are much smaller than those of H4MF, proving that the item constraints can reduce the redundancy of user intents.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of item constraints, we tune the \u03bbInner and \u03bbOuter to observe how they influence the HR@50 of H4MFc. We fix other parameters as described in Section 5.2 and show the results in Figure 3.",
        "The asymmetric relations of items are revealed from the temporal data by the dynamical missingness mechanism.",
        "We proposed a framework that seamlessly combines HMM and MF to model the dynamic missing mechanism of implicit feedback for recommendation.",
        "Future work includes extending H4MF with recent advanced variants of HMM and MF"
