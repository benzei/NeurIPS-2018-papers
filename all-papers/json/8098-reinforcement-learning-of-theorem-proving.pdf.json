    "abstract": "We introduce a theorem proving algorithm that uses practically no domain heuristics for guiding its connection-style proof search. Instead, it runs many MonteCarlo simulations guided by reinforcement learning from previous proof attempts. We produce several versions of the prover, parameterized by different learning and guiding algorithms. The strongest version of the system is trained on a large corpus of mathematical problems and evaluated on previously unseen problems. The trained system solves within the same number of inferences over 40% more problems than a baseline prover, which is an unusually high improvement in this hard AI domain. To our knowledge this is the first time reinforcement learning has been convincingly applied to solving general mathematical problems on a large scale."

  "summary": [
    "Automated theorem proving (ATP) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] can in principle be used to attack any formally stated mathematical problem.",
    "Based on the bare prover, we build a sequence of systems, adding Monte-Carlo tree search [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], and reinforcement learning [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] of policy and value guidance.",
    "For value learning we characterize the proof states of the nodes by extracting features from all goals, the active path, and the whole tableau.",
    "We use the M2k dataset to compare the performance of the baseline mlCoP with the bare prover and with the non-learning rlCoP using only UCT with the simple goal-counting proof state evaluation heuristic.",
    "RlCoP using UCT with no policy and only the simple proof state evaluation heuristic is weaker than mlCoP, already significantly better than the bare prover.",
    "We run on the M2k dataset 20 iterations of full rlCoP with UCT and both policy and value learning.",
    "We again measure the performance of the unguided systems, i.e., comparing mlCoP, the bare prover and the non-learning rlCoP using only UCT with the simple goal-counting proof state evaluation heuristic.",
    "We run 10 iterations of full rlCoP with UCT and both policy and value learning.",
    "RlCoP guided by the policy and value learned on the training data from iterations 0 − 4 proves 1624 testing problems, which is 42.1% more than mlCoP run with the same inference limit.",
    "An obvious question this performance comparison poses is how much can rlCoP improve solely by better machine learning in the current setting, and if further engineering and learning of more abstract guidance systems such as equality handling and literal/clause selection heuristics will be needed.",
    "All these theorems have nontrivial human-written formal proof in Mizar, and they are relatively hard to prove using state-of-the-art saturation-style ATPs. Figure 2 partially shows an example of the completed Monte-Carlo tree search for WAYBEL 0:28.",
    "Several systems have been produced recently that use supervised learning from large proof corpora for guiding the internal proof search of ATPs. This has been done in the connection tableau setting [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], saturation style setting [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], and as direct automation inside interactive theorem provers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>].",
    "The closest recent work is [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], where Monte-Carlo tree search is added to connection tableau, without reinforcement learning iterations, with complete backtracking, and without learned value.",
    "In this work we have developed a theorem proving algorithm that uses practically no domain engineering and instead relies on Monte-Carlo simulations guided by reinforcement learning from previous proof searches.",
    "We believe that development of suitable learning architectures that capture both syntactic and semantic features of the mathematical objects will be crucial for training strong assistants for mathematics and hard science by reinforcement learning"
