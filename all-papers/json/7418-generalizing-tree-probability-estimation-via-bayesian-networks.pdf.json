        "abstract": "Probability estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. However, standard methods for probability estimation on discrete objects do not handle object structure in a satisfactory manner. In this paper, we derive a general Bayesian network formulation for probability estimation on leaf-labeled trees that enables flexible approximations which can generalize beyond observations. We show that efficient algorithms for learning Bayesian networks can be easily extended to probability estimation on this challenging structured space. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our methods greatly outperform the current practice of using the empirical distribution, as well as a previous effort for probability estimation on trees."

    "summary": [
        "We present a general framework for tree probability estimation given a collection of trees (e.g., MCMC samples) by introducing a novel structure called subsplit Bayesian networks (SBNs).",
        "For general SBNs, the estimated tree probabilities take the following form: psbn(T ) = p(S1) p(Si|S\u03c0i ).",
        "The SBN formulation allows us to extend many efficient algorithms for learning Bayesian networks to SBNs for tree probability estimation, as we see .",
        "Similar to the SBN approximations for the rooted trees, (5) provides a natural probability distribution over unrooted trees.",
        "Taking q to be uniform on the 2N \u2212 3 tree edges together with conditional probability sharing gives the simple average (SA) lower bound of the data log-likelihood",
        "This, together with conditional probability sharing, leads to an extension of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for learning SBNs, which allows us use of the Bayesian formulation.",
        "At the E-step of the n-th iteration, an adaptive lower bound is constructed through (6) using the conditional probabilities of the missing root node qk(n)(S1) = p(S1|Tku, pEM,(n)), k = 1, .",
        "The computational complexities of maximum lower bound estimate and each EM iteration are both O(KN ), the same as CCD and SBNs for rooted trees.",
        "We compare sbn-sa, sbn-em, sbn-em-\u03b1 to the classical sample relative frequency (SRF) method and CCD on a synthetic data set and on estimating phylogenetic tree posteriors for a number of real data sets.",
        "We see that the learning rate of CCD slows down very quickly as the data size increases, implying that the conditional clade independence assumption could be too strong to provide flexible approximations.",
        "We apply SBN algorithms, SRF and CCD to the posterior samples in each of the 10 replicates for each data set.",
        "SBNs allow us to exploit the similarity among trees to provide a wide range of flexible probability estimators that generalize beyond observations.",
        "We present SBNs in the context of leaf-labeled bifurcating trees, it can be adapted for general leaf-labeled trees by allowing partitions other than subsplits of the clades in parent nodes.",
        "We leave for future work investigating the performance of more complicated SBNs for general trees, structure learning of SBNs, deeper examination of the effect of parameter sharing, and further applications of SBNs to other probabilistic learning problems in tree spaces, such as designing more efficient tree proposals for MCMC transition kernels and providing flexible and tractable distributions for variational inference."

This conservative setting has been shown to find all posterior modes on these data sets [Whidden and Matsen, 2015]. We collect the posterior samples every 100 iterations of these runs and discard the first 25% as burn-in.
