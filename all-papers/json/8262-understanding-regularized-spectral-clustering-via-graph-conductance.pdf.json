        "abstract": "This paper uses the relationship between graph conductance and spectral clustering to study (i) the failures of spectral clustering and (ii) the benefits of regularization. The explanation is simple. Sparse and stochastic graphs create several \u201cdangling sets\u201d, or small trees that are connected to the core of the graph by only one edge. Graph conductance is sensitive to these noisy dangling sets and spectral clustering inherits this sensitivity. The second part of the paper starts from a previously proposed form of regularized spectral clustering and shows that it is related to the graph conductance on a \u201cregularized graph\u201d. When graph conductance is computed on the regularized graph, we call it CoreCut. Based upon previous arguments that relate graph conductance to spectral clustering (e.g. Cheeger inequality), minimizing CoreCut relaxes to regularized spectral clustering. Simple inspection of CoreCut reveals why it is less sensitive to dangling sets. Together, these results show that unbalanced partitions from spectral clustering can be understood as overfitting to noise in the periphery of a sparse and stochastic graph. Regularization fixes this overfitting. In addition to this statistical benefit, these results also demonstrate how regularization can improve the computational speed of spectral clustering. We provide simulations and data examples to illustrate these results."

        "In Figure 1, the delocalized singular vector from regularized spectral clustering leads to a \u201cdeeper cut\u201d into the core of the graph.",
        "The argument in this paper is structured as follows: 1) A g-dangling set has a small graph conductance, approximately (2g)\u22121.",
        "2) For any fixed g, graphs sampled from a sparse inhomogeneous model with N nodes have \u0398(N ) g-dangling sets in expectation.",
        "4) CoreCut, which is graph conductance on the regularized graph, does not assign a small value to small sets of nodes.",
        "This experiment randomly divides the edges into training set and test set, runs spectral clustering using the training edges and with the resulting partition, and compares \u201ctraining edge conductance\u201d to \u201ctesting edge conductance.\u201d This shows that Vanilla-SC overfits and Regularized-SC does not.",
        "3.1 Dangling sets have small graph conductance.",
        "A graph is generated from an inhomogeneous random graph model if the vertex set contains N nodes and all edges are independent.",
        "If that model contains a non-vanishing fraction of peripheral nodes Vp \u2282 V , such that |Vp| > \u03b7N for some \u03b7 > 0, the expected number of non-overlapping g-dangling sets in the sampled graph grows proportionally to N .",
        "For example in Figure 3a, S i \u2019s (i = 1, ..., 5) are small peripheral sets and S1, S2 are core sets, each with roughly half of all nodes.",
        "Assumption 1 indicates that the peripheral set S is a very small part of G in terms of number of nodes and number of edges.",
        "Even though we argue that regularized approaches are trying to minimize CoreCut, every notion of conductance is computed on the unregularized graph G, including the scanning through the second eigenvector.",
        "In Figure 4, the summary value is the number of nodes in the smaller partition set.",
        "Because the regularized form from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] defines L\u03c4 = I \u2212 D\u03c4\u22121/2AD\u03c4\u22121/2, it can use the same eigensolver as Vanilla-SC and, as such, the running times are more comparable.",
