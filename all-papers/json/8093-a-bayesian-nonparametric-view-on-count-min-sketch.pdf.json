        "abstract": "The count-min sketch is a timeand memory-efficient randomized data structure that provides a point estimate of the number of times an item has appeared in a data stream. The count-min sketch and related hash-based data structures are ubiquitous in systems that must track frequencies of data such as URLs, IP addresses, and language n-grams. We present a Bayesian view on the count-min sketch, using the same data structure, but providing a posterior distribution over the frequencies that characterizes the uncertainty arising from the hash-based approximation. In particular, we take a nonparametric approach and consider tokens generated from a Dirichlet process (DP) random measure, which allows for an unbounded number of unique tokens. Using properties of the DP, we show that it is possible to straightforwardly compute posterior marginals of the unknown true counts and that the modes of these marginals recover the count-min sketch estimator, inheriting the associated probabilistic guarantees. Using simulated data with known ground truth, we investigate the properties of these estimators. Lastly, we also study a modified problem in which the observation stream consists of collections of tokens (i.e., documents) arising from a random measure drawn from a stable beta process, which allows for power law scaling behavior in the number of unique tokens.",

        "We review the Dirichlet process, revisiting the assumptions about the sketched data stream, leading to a form for the posterior marginals over the counts.",
        "The count-min (CM) sketch [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] is a randomized data structure that uses random hashing to approximate count statistics of a data stream of tokens.",

        "In a Bayesian setting, the point query induces instead a posterior distribution over the unknown true counts of a token, conditioned on the observed counts in the counter array C.",
        "The posterior of the count summarized in Theorem 2 relies on two results: (1) the distribution of tokens in each bucket is a Chinese restaurant process with parameter \u03b1/J, and (2) the posterior of a single hash can be obtained from the CRP(\u03b1/J) distribution (Proposition 1).",
        "The CRP has precisely the structure that we seek to reason about in our point query: some finite number of objects have hashed into this bucket, and we need to construct a posterior on how those might be partitioned into groups of identical tokens.",
