        "abstract": "While recent developments in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology highlight substantial progress, we lack tools for rigorous and scalable testing. Real-world testing, the de facto evaluation environment, places the public in danger, and, due to the rare nature of accidents, will require billions of miles in order to statistically validate performance claims. We implement a simulation framework that can test an entire modern autonomous driving system, including, in particular, systems that employ deep-learning perception and control algorithms. Using adaptive importance-sampling methods to accelerate rare-event probability evaluation, we estimate the probability of an accident under a base distribution governing standard traffic behavior. We demonstrate our framework on a highway scenario, accelerating system evaluation by 2-20 times over naive Monte Carlo sampling methods and 10-300P times (where P is the number of processors) over real-world testing."

    "summary": [
        "Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have accelerated the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs); many research prototypes operate on real roads alongside human drivers.",
        "We use the cross-entropy algorithm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] to iteratively approximate the optimal importance sampling distribution.",
        "The use of adaptive-importance sampling methods motivates a unique simulator architecture (Section 3) which allows real-time updates of the policies of environment vehicles.",
        "Cross-entropy method As an alternative to a naive Monte Carlo estimator, we consider importance sampling [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and we use a model-based optimization procedure to find a good importance-sampling distribution.",
        "Two key considerations in our risk-based framework influence design choices for our simulation toolchain: (1) learning the base distribution P0 of nominal traffic behavior via data-driven modeling, and (2) testing the AV as a whole system.",
        "Our importance sampling and cross-entropy methods use not just a single instance of model parameters \u03be, but rather a distribution over them to form a generative model of human driving behavior.",
        "As \u03c1 approaches 0, the cross-entropy method learns importance samplers P\u03b8 that up-weight unsafe regions of X with lower f (x), increasing the frequency of sampling rare events \u2264 \u03b3).",
        "We consistently observe that the cross-entropy method learns to sample significantly more rare events, despite the high-dimensional nature (d \u2248 500) of the problem.",
        "For a given number of samples, the cross-entropy method with \u03c1 = 0.01 provides more precise estimates for the rare-event probability p\u03b3 \u2248 10\u22125 over naive Monte Carlo.",
        "Based on our computational budget, we choose K = 20 and Nk = 1000 for the cross-entropy method to learn a good importance sampling distribution for the vision-based policy.",
        "While this approach requires a learned model of the world P0\u2014a highly nontrivial statistical task in itself\u2014the adaptive importance sampling techniques we employ can still efficiently identify dangerous scenarios even when P0 is not completely accurate.",
        "Verified subsystems provide evidence that the AV should drive safely even if the estimated distribution shifts, but verification techniques are limited by computational intractability as well as the need for both white-box models and the completeness of specifications that assign blame (e.g.",
        "Our risk-based framework is most useful when the base distribution P0 is accurate, but even when P0 is misspecified, our adaptive importance sampling techniques can still efficiently identify dangerous scenarios, especially those that may be missed by verification methods attempting to assign blame.",
        "Our framework offers significant speedups over real-world testing and allows efficient evaluation of black-box AV input/output behavior, providing a powerful tool to aid in the design of safe AVs. AS, HN, and JD were partially supported by the SAIL-Toyota Center for AI Research."
