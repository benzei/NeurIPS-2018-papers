        "abstract": "The classic Mallows model is a widely-used tool to realize distributions on permutations. Motivated by common practical situations, in this paper, we generalize Mallows to model distributions on top-k lists by using a suitable distance measure between top-k lists. Unlike many earlier works, our model is both analytically tractable and computationally efficient. We demonstrate this by studying two basic problems in this model, namely, sampling and reconstruction, from both algorithmic and experimental points of view."

        "The second is an approximate sampling algorithm based on Markov chains with a running time that is poly(k).",
        "There is an algorithm that generates a top-k list according to Mk,n in time O(k24k + k2 log n).",
        "Given an n \u00d7 n non-negative matrix P (\u00b7, \u00b7) with entries in [0, 1], an n-adjacent transposition Markov chain is defined on Sn as follows: at state \u03c4 \u2208 Sn, pick i u.a.r. and place \u03c4 (i) and \u03c4 (i + 1) in the natural order w.p.

        "We give a simple algorithm for provably reconstructing the central top-k list, given enough samples from M\u03b2.",
        "The goal of the reconstruction problem is, given enough samples generated according to the mixture, learn their centers.",
        "We first show that our Markov chain based algorithm can efficiently sample top-k lists.",
        "While our reconstruction algorithm from Theorem 9 assumes that there are enough samples, we generalize it based on the Condorcet criterion and a tie-breaking rule.",

        "Our work opens several promising research directions, including improving the running times, sample complexity bounds, and extending the model to other measures on top-k lists [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]."
