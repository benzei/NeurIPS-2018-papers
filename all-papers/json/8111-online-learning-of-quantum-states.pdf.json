        "abstract": "Suppose we have many copies of an unknown n-qubit state \u03c1. We measure some copies of \u03c1 using a known two-outcome measurement E1, then other copies using a measurement E2, and so on. At each stage t, we generate a current hypothesis \u03c9t about the state \u03c1, using the outcomes of the previous measurements. We show that it is possible to do this in a way that guarantees that |Tr(Ei\u03c9t) \u2212 Tr(Ei\u03c1)|, the error in our prediction for the next measurement, is at least \u03b5 at most O n/\u03b52 times. Even in the \u201cnon-realizable\u201d setting\u2014where there could be arbitrary noise in the measure\u221ament outcomes\u2014we show how to output hypothesis states that incur at most O( T n ) excess loss over the best possible state on the first T measurements. These results generalize a 2007 theorem by Aaronson on the PAC-learnability of quantum states, to the online and regret-minimization settings. We give three different ways to prove our results\u2014using convex optimization, quantum postselection, and sequential fat-shattering dimension\u2014which have different advantages in terms of parameters and portability."
