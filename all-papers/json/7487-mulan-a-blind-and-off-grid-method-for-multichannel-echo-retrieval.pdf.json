        "abstract": "This paper addresses the general problem of blind echo retrieval, i.e., given M sensors measuring in the discrete-time domain M mixtures of K delayed and attenuated copies of an unknown source signal, can the echo locations and weights be recovered? This problem has broad applications in fields such as sonars, seismology, ultrasounds or room acoustics. It belongs to the broader class of blind channel identification problems, which have been intensively studied in signal processing. Existing methods in the literature proceed in two steps: (i) blind estimation of sparse discrete-time filters and (ii) echo information retrieval by peak-picking on filters. The precision of these methods is fundamentally limited by the rate at which the signals are sampled: estimated echo locations are necessary on-grid, and since true locations never match the sampling grid, the weight estimation precision is impacted. This is the so-called basis-mismatch problem in compressed sensing. We propose a radically different approach to the problem, building on the framework of finite-rate-of-innovation sampling. The approach operates directly in the parameter-space of echo locations and weights, and enables near-exact blind and off-grid echo retrieval from discrete-time measurements. It is shown to outperform conventional methods by several orders of magnitude in precision."

    "summary": [
        "The signal and measurement models<br/><br/>We start by defining the signal model in the continuous-time domain.",
        "Because they work in the discrete-time domain, the accuracy at which these methods can recover echo locations is fundamentally limited by the signal\u2019s frequency of sampling: the recovered echoes are on-grid.",
        "It is important to note that contrary to intuition, even in the idealized case where an infinite number of samples are available, the discrete-time filters {hm}m M=1 involved in the measurement model are never streams of Diracs, but non-sparse, infinite-length filters consisting of decimated combinations of sinc functions.",
        "To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, all existing methods in blind channel identification rely on the discrete-time model (5) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",
        "We introduce a novel method for echo recovery that makes use of the discrete-frequency model (11) and overcomes a number of shortcomings of existing approaches.",
        "It works directly in the parameter space, it does not rely on the filters\u2019 length but on the number of echoes, and it enables exact off-grid recovery of echoes\u2019 locations and weights in the noiseless case.",
        "We start by considering the non-blind case where the emitted signal s \u2208 CF in the discrete frequency domain is known.",
        "If the algorithm succeeds in bringing down the cost function to zero, it means that appropriate annihilating filters have been found for all channels for a given Fourier-inverted signal z, and the locations and weights of all Diracs can be recovered.",
        "The identifiability of blind channel identification for general discrete filters and signals has been studied some time ago [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
        "While other common roots may appear in the general setting, it is important to note that MULAN restricts the search of filters to those which are linear combinations of geometrical series in the frequency domain.",
        "We first emphasize the specific ability of the proposed method to recover echo locations off-grid by comparing it to conventional on-grid methods on a simulated room-acoustic scenario and on an artificial scenario with truly sparse discrete filters for reference.",
        "For the artificial scenario, the speech source was discretely convolved with sparse filters of similar length with K = 7 nonzero elements each resulting in N = 4000 samples of M -channel observations.",
