We review known results, and derive new results, estimating the capacity of several neuronal models: linear and polynomial threshold gates, linear and polynomial threshold gates with constrained weights (binary weights, positive weights), and ReLU neurons. We also derive some capacity estimates and bounds for fully recurrent networks, as well as feedforward networks."
