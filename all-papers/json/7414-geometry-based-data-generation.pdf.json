        "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput technologies measuring high-dimensional biological data, there is a pressing need for visualization tools that reveal the structure and emergent patterns of data in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure in data by an information-geometry distance between datapoints. We perform extensive comparison between PHATE and other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data including continual progressions, branches, and clusters. We show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of datatypes including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, Hi-C, and gut microbiome data, where it can generate interpretable insights into the underlying systems. Finally, we use PHATE to explore a newly generated scRNA-seq dataset of human germ layer differentiation. Here, PHATE reveals a dynamic picture of the main developmental branches in unparalleled detail."

        "SUGAR selectively generates points to equalize density; as such, the method can be used generally to compensate for sparsity and heavily biased sampling in data in a way that is agnostic to downstream application.",
        "Since an adaptive bandwidth obscures density biases, it is more suitable for applying the resulting diffusion process to the data than for degree estimation.",
        "Geometry and generate new data points from the manifold.",
        "We use this diffusion process to generate new data points along the manifold geometry while adjusting their intrinsic distribution, as explained .",
        "SUGAR initializes by forming a Gaussian kernel GX over the input data X in order to estimate the degree d(i) of each xi \u2208 X.",
        "We use this kernel to pull the new points Y 0 toward the sparse regions of the manifold M using the row-stochastic diffusion operator P.",
        "Given a biased dataset X, we wish to generate points in sparse regions such that the resulting density over M becomes uniform.",
        "[max(d(\u00b7)) \u2212 d(i)] , where d(i) is the degree value at point xi, \u03c32 is the bandwidth of the kernel K (Eq 1) and \u03a3i is the covariance of the Gaussian designed for generating new points.",
        "Both SUGAR (t = 1) and the VAE generated points along the circular structure of the original manifold.",
        "Points generated by SUGAR occupied new angles not present in the original data but clearly present along the circular manifold.",
        "SUGAR was used to generate new points based on(i) around each original point (Fig. 2(b), before diffusion, 2(c), after diffusion).",
        "Augmenting the biased data via SUGAR equalizes the sampling density, restoring ground-truth neighborhood structure to the graph built on the data.",
        "SUGAR was used to generate new points for clustering together with the original data.",
        "We first sought to enrich rare phenotypes in the Velten data by generating Y \u2208 R4116\u00d712553 new data points with SUGAR.",
