        "abstract": "Archived data from the US network of weather radars hold detailed information about bird migration over the last 25 years, including very high-resolution partial measurements of velocity. Historically, most of this spatial resolution is discarded and velocities are summarized at a very small number of locations due to modeling and algorithmic limitations. This paper presents a Gaussian process (GP) model to reconstruct high-resolution full velocity fields across the entire US. The GP faithfully models all aspects of the problem in a single joint framework, including spatially random velocities, partial velocity measurements, station-specific geometries, measurement noise, and an ambiguity known as aliasing. We develop fast inference algorithms based on the FFT; to do so, we employ a creative use of Laplace\u2019s method to sidestep the fact that the kernel of the joint process is non-stationary."

        "Our first contribution is a joint Gaussian process (GP) to simultaneously model the radial velocity measurements from all radar stations.",
        "Figure 1(b) shows example radial velocity information measured from the KBGM radar in Binghamton, NY on the night of September 11, 2010, during which there was heavy bird migration.",
        "This is conventionally for approximate inference when the likelihood is not Gaussian, but we use it to be able to utilize fast kernel operations for the latent GP, which is stationary, and the method will still be exact.",
        "Laplace\u2019s method replaces one-shot matrix inversion based inference with an iterative algorithm where the most complicated operation is kernel-vector multiplication.",
        "If we pick locations to observe radial velocity measurements on a grid \u03a9, we can perform the matrix-vector multiplication Ks, for an arbitrary vector s, in O(n log n) time, where n = |\u03a9|.",
        "Recall that aliasing means that radial velocities are only known up to an additive multiple of twice the Nyquist velocity Vmax, which varies by operating mode of the radar.",
        "Hyperparameters are fixed at values chosen through preliminary experiments to match the expected smoothness of the data, so that the RMSE between inferred radial velocities and raw measurements match values from velocity models used in prior research [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
        "Error is measured by first inferring the full velocity vector for each observation and projecting it using the station-specific geometry to compute the RMSE between the predicted and observed radial velocities.",
        "We use the raw radial velocity data from 13 radar stations in the northeast US from the night of September 11, 2010.",
        "The inference method with Gaussian likelihood fails to infer a reasonable velocity field in the presence of heavily aliased radial velocity measurements and has a substantially higher RMSE1 than the method with the wrapped normal likelihood.",
        "A unique aspect of our method is that it can, for the first time, assimilate data from all radar stations to reconstruct spatially detailed velocity fields across the whole US.",
        "We presented the first comprehensive solution to the problem of inferring latent velocities from radial velocity measurements from weather radar stations across the US.",
        "Our end-to-end method probabilistic model begins with raw radial velocity from many radar stations, and outputs valuable information about migration patterns of birds at scale.",
        "We presented a novel method to perform fast grid-based posterior inference even though our GP does not have a stationary kernel.",
        "The results of our methods can be used by ecologists to expand human knowledge about bird movements to advance conservation efforts and science"
