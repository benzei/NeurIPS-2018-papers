        "abstract": "We here focus on the task of learning Granger causality matrices for multivariate point processes. In order to accomplish this task, our work is the first to explore the use of Wold processes. By doing so, we are able to develop asymptotically fast MCMC learning algorithms. With N being the total number of events and K the number of processes, our learning algorithm has a O(N ( log(N ) + log(K))) cost per iteration. This is much faster than the O(N 3 K2) or O(K3) for the state of the art. Our approach, called GRANGER-BUSCA, is validated on nine datasets. This is an advance in relation to most prior efforts which focus mostly on subsets of the Memetracker data. Regarding accuracy, GRANGER-BUSCA is three times more accurate (in Precision@10) than the state of the art for the commonly explored subsets Memetracker. Due to GRANGER-BUSCA\u2019s much lower training complexity, our approach is the only one able to train models for larger, full, sets of data."

        "A temporal point process P is a probability model for a collection of times {0 \u2264 t0 < t1 < t2 < . . .}<br/><br/>indexing the occurrences of random isolated events.",
        "The networked point process is a stochastic model for these systems, when data take the form of a time series of random events observed in each node.",
        "Similar to recent efforts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>], our goal in this work is to extract Granger causality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] from multivariate point process data only.",
        "When we measure the Precision@10 score between our Granger causal estimates and the ground-truth number of mentions of the commonly explored Memetracker data [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], our results are at least three times more accurate than the most recent and most accurate method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
        "Busca [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] is another point process model based on Wold processes and it is GRANGER-BUSCA\u2019s starting point.",
        "We define GRANGER-BUSCA using Figure 1, which exemplifies the behavior of the model with two processes.",
        "When the expected values of \u2206ba(t) are small, events in Pb usually precede Pa. In this sense, one intuition on how GRANGER-BUSCA works is that larger observed values of \u2206ba(t) lead to weaker evidence for the influence of process Pb on process Pa. The above behavior motivates GRANGER-BUSCA\u2019s multivariate conditional intensity function: \u03bba(t) =",
        "Given two processes Pa and Pb whose intensity functions follow Eq (3), Granger causality arises when \u03b1ba = 0 2.",
        "G is estimated based on the number of events that Pb caused on Pa, whereas \u03bc is estimated as the maximum likelihood rate for a Poisson process based on the exogenous events for Pa. We can learn GRANGER-BUSCA with an Expectation Maximization approach.",
        "In Table 2, we present the overall scores for GRANGER-BUSCA and the Hawkes-Cumulants (HC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] approach, focusing only on the Memetracker",
        "To present an overall view of GRANGER-BUSCA against all three competing methods (ADM4, HC and HG), in Figure 2 we show Precision@5, 10 and 20 scores for each approach on every Top-100 dataset.",
        "Recall that a Wold process is an adequate model when there is a strong dependency between consecutive inter-event times \u03b4t and \u03b4t+1.",
        "We present the first method to extract Granger causality matrices via Wold Processes.",
        "Called GRANGER-BUSCA, outperforms recent baseline methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>] both in training time and in overall accuracy.",
        "Given the efficacy of GRANGER-BUSCA, our hope is that current results may open up a new class of models, Wold processes, to be explored by the machine learning community.",
        "GRANGER-BUSCA can be used to explore real world behavior in complex large scale datasets"
