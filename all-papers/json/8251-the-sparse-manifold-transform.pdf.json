        "abstract": "We present a signal representation framework called the sparse manifold transform that combines key ideas from sparse coding, manifold learning, and slow feature analysis. It turns non-linear transformations in the primary sensory signal space into linear interpolations in a representational embedding space while maintaining approximate invertibility. The sparse manifold transform is an unsupervised and generative framework that explicitly and simultaneously models the sparse discreteness and low-dimensional manifold structure found in natural scenes. When stacked, it also models hierarchical composition. We provide a theoretical description of the transform and demonstrate properties of the learned representation on both synthetic data and natural videos."

        "The first step of LLE has the same linear formulation as sparse coding (1), with being the whole dataset rather than a learned dictionary, i.e., = X, where X is the data matrix.",
        "The dictionary may be thought of as a discrete sampling of a continuous manifold, and the sparse code of a data point provides the interpolation coefficients for determining its coordinates on the manifold.",

        "Assuming there are h such clusters, the k-sparse code of the image can be thought of as a discrete approximation of an underlying h-sparse function defined on the continuous manifold domain, where h is generally greater than 1 but less than k.",
        "The manifold sensing step acts to linearly pool the sparse codes, \u21b5, with a matrix, P , that is learned using the functional embedding concept in order to straighten trajectories arising from video data.",
        "The dictionary learned by sparse coding has an organization that is a discrete sampling of a low-dimensional, smooth manifold, M (Fig. 1).",
        "The elements of the underlying h-sparse function correspond to discrete components such as edges, corners, blobs or other features that are undergoing some simple set of transformations.",
        "The SMT is performed on an input signal x by first computing a higher-dimensional representation \u21b5 via sparse inference with a learned dictionary, , and second computing a contracted code by sensing a manifold representation, = P \u21b5 with a learned pooling matrix, P .",
        "The topology of the embedding learned from the SMT reflects the structural similarity of the dictionary elements according to the properties of position, orientation, and scale.",
        "The results confirm that the embedding space is succeeding in grouping dictionary elements according to their structural similarity, presumably due to the continuous geometric transformations occurring in image sequences."
