        "abstract": "Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) can be grouped into deterministic methods and Monte-Carlo-based methods. The former can often provide accurate and rapid inferences, but are typically associated with biases that are hard to quantify. The latter enjoy asymptotic consistency, but can suffer from high computational costs. In this paper we present a way of bridging the gap between deterministic and stochastic inference. Specifically, we suggest an efficient sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for PGMs which can leverage the output from deterministic inference methods. While generally applicable, we show explicitly how this can be done with loopy belief propagation, expectation propagation, and Laplace approximations. The resulting algorithm can be viewed as a post-correction of the biases associated with these methods and, indeed, numerical results show clear improvements over the baseline deterministic methods as well as over \u201cplain\u201d SMC."

        "The method is based on a sequence of artificial target distributions for the SMC sampler, constructed via a sequential graph decomposition.",
        "This approach has previously been used by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] for enabling SMC-based inference in PGMs. The proposed method has one important difference ; we introduce a so called twisting function in the targets obtained via the graph decomposition which allows for taking dependencies on \u201cfuture\u201d variables of the sequence into account.",
        "Computing the optimal twisting functions boils down to performing exact inference in the model, which is assumed to be intractable.",
        "The approximation of the twisting functions only affect the efficiency of the SMC sampler, not its asymptotic consistency, nor the unbiasedness of the normalizing constant estimate.",
        "Our method has the important difference that we do not only use the deterministic approximation to design the proposal, but to select the intermediate SMC targets via the design of efficient twisting functions.",
        "Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, see, e.g., [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]) is a class of importance-sampling-based algorithms that can be used to approximate some, quite arbitrary, sequence of probability distributions of interest.",
        "To see how loopy belief propagation can be used to approximate the twisting functions for SMC, we start with the following result for tree-structured model.",
        "When p is twice differentiable, it is straightforward to find an approximating Gaussian model based on a Laplace approximation by simple numerical optimization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], and use the obtained model as a basis of twisted SMC.",
        "We illustrate the proposed twisted SMC method on three PGMs using the three deterministic approximation methods discussed in Section 4.",
        "For computing the twisting functions we use the EP algorithm by Minka and Lafferty [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], specifically developed for inference in the LDA model.",
        "We simulated one realization of x1:T and y1:T from this configuration and estimated the log-likelihood of the model 10 000 times with a baseline SMC using a bootstrap proposal, as well as with twisted SMC where the twisting functions were computed using a Laplace log Z log Z",
        "The twisted SMC method for PGMs presented in this paper is a promising way to combine deterministic approximations with efficient Monte Carlo inference.",
        "It is not necessarily the case that the twisting functions obtained directly from the most accurate deterministic method result in the most efficient SMC sampler.",
        "It may be used as post-processing of approximate hyperparameter MCMC, which is based purely on deterministic PGM inferences [cf. 34]"
