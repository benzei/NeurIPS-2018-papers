        "abstract": "The high-dimensional convolution is widely used in various disciplines but has a serious performance problem due to its high computational complexity. Over the decades, people took a handmade approach to design fast algorithms for the Gaussian convolution. Recently, requirements for various non-Gaussian convolutions have emerged and are continuously getting higher. However, the handmade acceleration approach is no longer feasible for so many different convolutions since it is a time-consuming and painstaking job. Instead, we propose an Acceleration Network (AccNet) which turns the work of designing new fast algorithms to training the AccNet. This is done by: 1, interpreting splatting, blurring, slicing operations as convolutions; 2, turning these convolutions to gCP layers to build AccNet. After training, the activation function g together with AccNet weights automatically define the new splatting, blurring and slicing operations. Experiments demonstrate AccNet is able to design acceleration algorithms for a ton of convolutions including Gaussian/non-Gaussian convolutions and produce state-of-the-art results."

        "The high-dimensional convolution undoubtedly is a common and elementary computation unit in machine learning, computer vision and computer graphics.",
        "The benefits are threefold: 1, our AccNet offers a unified perspective for SBS based acceleration methods; 2, the layer weights together with the activation function g define the splatting, blurring and slicing convolution.",
        "We can derive new splatting, blurring and slicing operations from the trained network for arbitrary convolutions.",
        "Different from traditional output-focused neural networks, our AccNet implements the design-bytraining strategy to automatically produce fast convolution pipeline and only interests in the activation function and weights as they define new splatting, blurring and slicing operations.",
        "Our design-by-training approach is to decompose the filtering kernel (a tensor) by neural networks because a convolution can be fast computed according to (5) once (4) is obtained.",
        "Even though the splatting layer is simple, the approximation error can be reduced by increasing the complexity of the blurring layer; 2, each slice of the input tensor of the blurring layer must be a rank-one matrix and the filtering result",
        "This is because splatting, blurring and slicing operations are essentially convolutions we can take different gCTs and gHTs to accelerate their computation.",
        "From AccNet to SBS: the weights as well as the activation function of three AccNet layers define the splatting, blurring and slicing kernels.",
        "The correspondences between AccNet weights and convolution kernels are determined by (7) (8) for the gCP decomposition and (11) (12) for the gHT decomposition.",
        "2 i=1 kimj , where circles denote convolution operations with specific filtering kernels k and arrows indicate the computation order.",
        "Three experiments are conducted: 1, we compare our AccNet designed acceleration method to the handmade bilateral grid and permutohedral lattice acceleration methods; 2, we provide a new neural network to automatically design fast algorithm and compare it to AccNet; 3, we employ AccNet to design new acceleration algorithms for non-Gaussian convolution and demonstrate their applications.",
        "The blurring layer of AccNet is composed by two cascaded gCP layers and the activation function is g(a, b) = max.",
        "The differences between this network and our AccNet are that: 1, the depth of each layer of this CNN model is proportional to the dimension of filtering kernel.",
        "We take AccNet to express the approximation function of SBS and generalize SBS by changing the architecture of AccNet. Once training is finished, new fast convolution algorithm can be derived from the weights and activation functions of each layer."
