        "abstract": "The co-occurrence of multiple diseases among the general population is an important problem as those patients have more risk of complications and represent a large share of health care expenditure. Learning to predict time-to-event probabilities for these patients is a challenging problem because the risks of events are correlated (there are competing risks) with often only few patients experiencing individual events of interest, and of those only a fraction are actually observed in the data. We introduce in this paper a survival model with the flexibility to leverage a common representation of related events that is designed to correct for the strong imbalance in observed outcomes. The procedure is sequential: outcome-specific survival distributions form the components of nonparametric multivariate estimators which we combine into an ensemble in such a way as to ensure accurate predictions on all outcome types simultaneously. Our algorithm is general and represents the first boosting-like method for time-to-event data with multiple outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on synthetic and real data."

        "What distinguishes our weighting scheme from existing boosting methods is that while the output of each weak estimator is a multivariate probability distribution, the data only provides the specific event that occurred and the time of occurrence and we introduce new notions of \"prediction correctness\" that apply in our setting.",
        "Survival data in the presence of competing risks is often highly heterogeneous, the process of boosting is effective for identifying patients that do not conform to a general pattern; a fact further exacerbated when only few examples are available from each type or if imbalance is large.",
        "The following subsections will detail first the training procedure of weak predictors and will provide the ensemble approach that results in flexible task-specific time-to-event distributions.",
        "In the context of competing risks homogeneity of time-to-event outcomes otherwise measured with the log-rank test statistic and model deviance in single event survival settings are not applicable.",
        "As nonparametric alternatives we consider Random Forests for survival data under competing risks (RSF) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] and a weighted version (Weighted RSF) that attempts to mitigate task imbalance by sampling low incidence instances with higher probability such as to achieve balanced tasks in each bootstrapped sample.",
        "In a second experiment we evaluate model task-specific predictions in comparison to baseline algorithms introduced in section 5.1 with the C-index averaged over all time horizons t.",
        "In comparison to SMTBoost we believe that it is the stronger focus on divergent instances that leads to the gain in performance with respect to RSF and weighted RSF because the exponential transformation of covariate interactions for both tasks leads to highly divergent event times even between observations that have similar covariate values.",
        "We constructed an additional more general synthetic experiment designed to express complex and heterogeneous survival patterns between 2 tasks to further understand performance in imbalanced data sets.",

        "Our experiments on synthetic and real medical data have demonstrated large performance improvements over current techniques and show the advantage of a boosting framework, already observed in classification and regression problems, in the field of time-to-event analysis.",
