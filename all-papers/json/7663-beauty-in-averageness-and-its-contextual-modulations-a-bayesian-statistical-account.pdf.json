        "abstract": "Understanding how humans perceive the likability of high-dimensional ``objects'' such as faces is an important problem in both cognitive science and AI/ML. Existing models of human preferences generally assume these preferences to be fixed. However, human assessment of facial attractiveness have been found to be highly context-dependent. Specifically, the classical Beauty-in-Averageness (BiA) effect, whereby a face blended from two original faces is judged to be more attractive than the originals, is significantly diminished or reversed when the original faces are recognizable, or when the morph is mixed-race/mixed gender and the attractiveness judgment is preceded by a race/gender categorization. This effect, dubbed Ugliness-in-Averageness (UiA), has previously been attributed to a disfluency account, which is both qualitative and clumsy in explaining BiA. We hypothesize, instead, that these contextual influences on face processing result from the dependence of attractiveness perception on an element of statistical typicality, and from an attentional mechanism that restricts face representation to a task-relevant subset of features, thus redefining typicality within that subspace. Furthermore, we propose a principled explanation of why statistically atypical objects are less likable: they incur greater encoding or processing cost associated with a greater prediction error, when the brain uses predictive coding to compare the actual stimulus properties with those expected from its associated categorical prototype. We use simulations to show  our model provides a parsimonious, statistically grounded, and quantitative account of contextual dependence of attractiveness. We also validate our model using experimental data from a gender categorization task. Finally, we make model predictions for a proposed experiment that can disambiguate the previous disfluency account and our statistical typicality theory."

        "When the observer performs a categorization task, such as race discrimination, we assume the attractiveness of a face stimulus is proportional to the category-conditional log-likelihood log pX (x|c), where c is the estimated category, among those of potential interest, based on the general distribution pX (x).",
        "We use this face data-informed AAM representation to make nuanced predictions about facial attractiveness as a function of % blend between faces of different races or different genders [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
        "Defined as category-conditional log likelihood, has an inverted U shape (BiA) relative to % racial blend in the original space (Figures 3e) or a random subspace, but a U shape (UiA) in the race-informative subspace (Figures 3g).",
        "When 60 pairs of male and female faces are randomly drawn and blended in different proportions, the model predicts typicality, and attractiveness, to have similar BiA (Figures 3f) and UiA effects (Figures 3h).",
        "We propose a statistically grounded model of human \u201cliking\u201d, whereby the attractiveness of a stimulus depends on its neural coding cost, in particular how likely it is relative to its perceived category.",
        "This argument is based on information-theoretic considerations, in particular the coding cost associated with statistically unlikely stimuli, and is related to Barlow\u2019s \u201cefficient coding hypothesis.\u201d we assume that humans naturally project high-dimensional data, such as faces, in a task-relevant manner to a low-dimensional subspace representation, either via top-down goal-directed specification, or via bottom-up saliency.",
        "The attractiveness of a stimulus is context-dependent for two different reasons: (1) the set of hypotheses under consideration in the Bayesian posterior computation is context-dependent, and (2) the statistical distribution corresponding to the generative model changes according to the featural subspace that supports the current task.",
        "In addition to providing a statistically grounded explanation of contextual dependence of human attractiveness judgment, our work provides some general insight as to how high-dimensional data can be analyzed and stored efficiently: the system needs to be able to dynamically shift its subspace projection according to task demands, so as to reduce the need for representational and computational complexity at any given moment.",
        "The other route is unsupervised, saliency-induced subspace projection, in which the statistically unlikely features of a high-dimensional stimulus are privileged in their processing and encoding, and subsequent computations are performed within this subspace \u2013 this is what underlies our explanation of the UiA effect in celebrity-blend faces."
