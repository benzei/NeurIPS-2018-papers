        "abstract": "Machine learning models are changing the paradigm of molecular modeling, which is a fundamental tool for material science, chemistry, and computational biology. Of particular interest is the inter-atomic potential energy surface (PES). Here we develop Deep Potential - Smooth Edition (DeepPot-SE), an end-to-end machine learning-based PES model, which is able to efficiently represent the PES of a wide variety of systems with the accuracy of ab initio quantum mechanics models. By construction, DeepPot-SE is extensive and continuously differentiable, scales linearly with system size, and preserves all the natural symmetries of the system. Further, we show that DeepPot-SE describes finite and extended systems including organic molecules, metals, semiconductors, and insulators with high fidelity."

    "summary": [
        "Representing the inter-atomic potential energy surface (PES), both accurately and efficiently, is one of the most challenging problems in molecular modeling.",
        "The Deep Potential model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] represents the PES as a sum of \"atomic\" energies that depend on the coordinates of the atoms in each atomic environment in a symmetry-preserving way.",
        "We test the DeepPot-SE model on various systems, which extend previous studies by incorporating DFT data for challenging materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs).",
        "We denote the full parameter set used to parametrize E by w, and we write the corresponding PES model as Ew(R) \u2261 Ew. The force F w and the virial \u039ew can be directly computed from Ew. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in the DeepPot-SE model, the extensive property of the total energy is preserved by decomposing it into \u201catomic contributions\u201d that are represented by the so-called subnetworks, i.e.: Ew(R) = Ew\u03b1i (Ri) \u2261 Ei, (3)",
        "The encoding network is specially designed to map the local environment Ri to an embedded feature space, which preserves the translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries of the system.",
        "Granted the fitting ability of neural networks, the key to a general representation is an embedding procedure that maps the original input r to symmetry preserving components.",
        "The M1 \u00d7 M2 components contained in the feature matrix Di are reshaped into a vector to serve as the input of the fitting network, and yield the \u201catomic energy\" Ei. In the Supplementary Materials, we show explicitly that Di, and the DeepPot-SE model, preserves all the necessary symmetries.",
        "Considering the explanation of the Deep Potential [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] and the fact that M1 is much larger than M2 in practice, we view the role of (Gi1)T Ri as being the mapping from the atomic point pattern to a feature space that preserves permutation symmetry.",
        "The multi-component nature of this system, the extended character of the substrate, and the different sizes of the supported clusters with grand-canonical-like features, make this system very challenging for an end-to-end framework.",
        "As shown by Table 2, the DeepPot-SE model not only is able to fit snapshots with random allocations of atoms in the training data, but show great promise in transferring to systems with random locations that seem significantly different from the training data.",
        "We developed DeepPot-SE, an end-to-end, scalable, symmetry preserving, and accurate potential energy model.",
        "We show that this model can describe cases with diverse electronic structure such as metals, insulators, and semiconductors, as well as diverse degrees of complexity such as bulk crystals, surfaces, and high entropy alloys.",
