        "abstract": "Observational data is increasingly used as a means for making individual-level causal predictions and intervention recommendations. The foremost challenge of causal inference from observational data is hidden confounding, whose presence cannot be tested in data and can invalidate any causal conclusion. Experimental data does not suffer from confounding but is usually limited in both scope and scale. We introduce a novel method of using limited experimental data to correct the hidden confounding in causal effect models trained on larger observational data, even if the observational data does not fully overlap with the experimental data. Our method makes strictly weaker assumptions than existing approaches, and we prove conditions under which it yields a consistent estimator. We demonstrate our method\u2019s efficacy using real-world data from a large educational experiment."

        "Hidden confounding can lead to no-vanishing bias in causal estimates even in the limit of infinite samples [Pea09]",
        "We focus on the setting where (1) the observational data is of much larger scale nUnc \u2327 nConf and/or (2) the support of the unconfounded data Support(XiUnc) = {x : P kXiUnc xk",

        "Can be identified by regressing observed outcomes on treatment and covariates in the unconfounded data.",
        "The first, is to learn the treatment effect function directly from the unconfounded data, and extrapolate it to the observational sample.",
        "The reason is that we assume that the confounded study does not fully overlap with the unconfounded study, which requires extrapolating the estimated CATE function into a region of sample space outside the region where it was fit.",
        "We note that if the so-called confounded observational sample is unconfounded we immediately get that the linear specification of \u2318 is correct with \u27130 = 0 because we have \u2318(x) = 0.",
        "If we fit !\u02c6 by empirical risk minimization on weighted outcomes over a function class of finite capacity or if we fit as the difference of two regression functions each fit by empirical risk minimization on observed outcomes in each treatment group, standard results in statistical learning [BM02] ensure the consistency of L2 risk and the L2 convergence required in condition 1.",
        "Our method can consistently estimate CATE on a population where no experimental data exists under weaker conditions than existing methods, which assume the observational data is unconfounded.",
        "This is important as it would be a rather strong requirement in the confounded sample where treatment choices may depend on high dimensional variables [DDF+17], but it is a weak condition for the experimental data.",
        "When generating CONF, we wish to obtain two goals: (a) the support of CONF should have only a partial overlap with the support of UNC, and (b) treatment assignment should be confounded, i.e. the treated and control populations should be systematically different in their potential outcomes.",
        "The reason we don\u2019t evaluate on ALL is twofold: First, it will only make the task easier because of the nature of the UNC set; second, we are motivated by the scenario where we have a confounded observational study representing the target population of interest, and wish to be aided by a separate unconfounded study available for a different population.",
