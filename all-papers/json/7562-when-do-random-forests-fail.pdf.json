        "abstract": "Random forests are learning algorithms that build large collections of random trees and make predictions by averaging the individual tree predictions. In this paper, we consider various tree constructions and examine how the choice of parameters affects the generalization error of the resulting random forests as the sample size goes to infinity. We show that subsampling of data points during the tree construction phase is important: Forests can become inconsistent with either no subsampling or too severe subsampling. As a consequence, even highly randomized trees can lead to inconsistent forests if no subsampling is used, which implies that some of the commonly used setups for random forests can be inconsistent. As a second consequence we can show that trees that have good performance in nearest-neighbor search can be a poor choice for random forests."

        "We consider n i.i.d. samples X1, . . . , Xn of an unknown random variable X that has support included in [0, 1]d.",
        "Viewing infinite random forests as local average estimators, we establish a series of inconsistency results in Section 4.",
        "In Section 4.1, we show that forests of deep trees with either nearest-neighbor-preserving property (Def. 6) or fast-diameter-decreasing property violate the diversity condition, when subsampling is disabled.",
        "We show that trees with nearest-neighbor-preserving property (Algorithm 1 and 2) can be inconsistent if we follow a common forest parameter setup (Def. 5).",
        "The following lemma shows that diversity is necessary for a local average estimator to be consistent on a large class of regression models.",
        "Viewing forests as a special type of local average estimators, we obtain several inconsistency results by considering the choice of subsampling rate in two extreme scenarios: in Section 4.1, we study trees without subsampling, and in Section 4.2, we study trees with constant subsample sizes.",
        "Suppose that the infinite random forest \u03b7n,V\u221e is built with totally randomized deep trees that satisfy the nearest-neighborpreserving property, Def. 6.",
        "The intuition behind Theorem 1 is that trees with nearest-neighbor-preserving property are highly homogeneous when subsampling is disabled: given a query point x, each tree in the forest tends to retrieve in its leaf of x a very similar set from the training data, namely those data points that are likely nearest neighbors of x.",
        "We speculate that proper subsampling can make the forests consistent again, while fixing other parameters: with subsampling, the nearest-neighbor-preserving property of the base tree algorithm should still hold, but each time applied on a subsample of the original data; taken together, all nearest neighbors on different subsamples are a much more significant set, diversity should work again.",
        "In particular in the latter case, random-projection tree based estimators were theoretically shown to be L2-consistent, with a convergence rate that adapts to the intrinsic data dimension for regression problems when they are pruned cleverly (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKpotufe_2012_a\" href=\"#rKpotufe_2012_a\">Kpotufe and Dasgupta, 2012</a>).",
        "Consider the random forest estimator \u03b7n,V\u221e built with totally randomized deep trees, and in addition, each tree leaf contains exactly one data point.",
        "Suppose that the random forest estimator \u03b7n,V\u221e has base trees that satisfy the following properties:",
        "Consider Theorem 2 in the bootstrap case: one would expect that the nearest neighbor property of random projection trees holds on bootstrapped samples as well); when the bootstrap sample size equals n, the setup will not differ much from the no-subsampling set up, and inconsistency should follow."
