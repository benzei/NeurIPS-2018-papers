        "abstract": "Person re-identification (reID) is an important task that requires to retrieve a person\u2019s images from an image dataset, given one image of the person of interest. For learning robust person features, the pose variation of person images is one of the key challenges. Existing works targeting the problem either perform human alignment, or learn human-region-based representations. Extra pose information and computational cost is generally required for inference. To solve this issue, a Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial Network (FD-GAN) is proposed for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated representations. It is a novel framework based on a Siamese structure with multiple novel discriminators on human poses and identities. In addition to the discriminators, a novel same-pose loss is also integrated, which requires appearance of a same person\u2019s generated images to be similar. After learning pose-unrelated person features with pose guidance, no auxiliary pose information and additional computational cost is required during testing. Our proposed FD-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three person reID datasets, which demonstrates that the effectiveness and robust feature distilling capability of the proposed FD-GAN. \u2021\u2021"

        "Person re-identification is a challenging task, with the purpose of matching pedestrian images with the same identity across multiple cameras.",

        "The pose information from the image features via adversarial training for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated representation.",
        "Due to the challenges from pose diversity for person reID datasets, we propose an novel GAN-based framework for distilling identity-related features.",
        "Our proposed Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial Network (FD-GAN) aims at learning identityrelated and pose-unrelated person representations, in order to handle large pose variations across images in person reID.",
        "The proposed FD-GAN adopts a Siamese structure, including an image encoder E, an image generator G, an identity verification classifier V and two adversarial discriminators, i.e., the identity discriminator Did and the pose discriminator Dpd. For each branch of the network, it takes a person image and a target pose landmark map as inputs.",
        "The assumption is intuitive, if the learned person features are pose-unrelated and identity-related, it can be used to accurately generate the same person\u2019s image but with different target poses.",
        "Its ResNet-50 sub-network for visual feature encoding does not share weights with that of our image encoder E, because the identity discriminator Did aims at distinguishing the identity between the real/fake images, while our image encoder targets at learning pose-unrelated person features.",
        "We input the same person\u2019s two different images and the same target pose to both branches of our Siamese network, if the conditioning visual features in the two branches are truly only identity-related, the two generated images should be similar in appearance.",
        "Our Siamese baseline model, which includes only the image encoder E and identity verification classifier V , is pretrained on a person reID dataset with only identity cross-entropy loss Lv in Eq (1).",
        "1) We adopt a Siamese network structure, which enables us to use the same-pose loss to encourage encoding only learning identity-related information, while DR-GAN does not have such a loss term.",
        "We proposed the novel FD-GAN for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated person representations with human pose guidance.",
        "Novel Siamese network structure as well as novel losses ensure the framework learns more pose-invariant features for robust person reID.",
        "Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on person reID without using additional computational cost or extra pose information during inference.",
