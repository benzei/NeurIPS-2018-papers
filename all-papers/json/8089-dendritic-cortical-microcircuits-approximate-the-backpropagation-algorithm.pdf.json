        "abstract": "Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind these advances \u2013 error backpropagation \u2013 appears to be at odds with neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback. Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem."

        "In this more recent work, the temporal difference between the activity of the apical dendrite in the presence and in the absence of the teaching input represents the error that induces plasticity at the forward synapses.",
        "Self-predicting nets are such that when no external target is provided to output layer neurons, the lateral input from interneurons cancels the internally generated top-down feedback and renders apical dendrites silent.",
        "Top-down weights are either set at random and kept fixed, in which case the equation above shows that the plasticity model optimizes the predictions according to an approximation of backprop known as feedback alignment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLillicrap_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLillicrap_et+al_2016_a\">Lillicrap et al, 2016</a>); or learned so as to minimize an inverse reconstruction loss, in which case the network implements a form of target propagation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBengio_2014_a\" href=\"#rBengio_2014_a\">Bengio, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2015_a\">Lee et al, 2015</a>).",
        "Given a self-predicting network, we focus on how prediction errors get propagated backwards when a novel teaching signal is provided to the output layer, modeled via the activation of additional somatic conductances in output pyramidal neurons.",
        "When the pyramidal cell activity in the output layer is nudged towards some desired target (Fig. 1B (i)), the bottom-up synapses W2P,P1 from the lower layer neurons to the basal dendrites are adapted, again according to the plasticity rule that implements the dendritic prediction of somatic spiking.",
        "We wondered how our model would fare in this benchmark, in particular whether the prediction errors computed by the interneuron microcircuit would allow learning the weights of a hierarchical nonlinear network with multiple hidden layers.",
        "Output layer neurons are nudged towards their desired target utNrgt, yielding updated somatic potentials uPN = (1 N ) vB,N + N uNtrgt.",
        "Interneurons are first updated to include top-down teaching signals, uIk = (1 I ) vkI + I ukP+1; this yields apical compartment potentials according to (4), after which we update hidden layer somatic potentials as a convex combination with mixing factor k.",
        "Apical compartment voltages remained approximately silent when output nudging was turned off, reflecting the maintenance of a self-predicting state throughout learning, which enabled the propagation of errors through the network.",
