        "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a low dimensional representation for compositional data. Compositional data consists of a collection of nonnegative data that sum to a constant value. Since the parts of the collection are statistically dependent, many standard tools cannot be directly applied. Instead, compositional data must be first transformed before analysis. Focusing on principal component analysis (PCA), we propose an approach that allows low dimensional representation learning directly from the original data. Our approach combines the benefits of the log-ratio transformation from compositional data analysis and exponential family PCA. A key tool in its derivation is a generalization of the scaled Bregman theorem, that relates the perspective transform of a Bregman divergence to the Bregman divergence of a perspective transform and a remainder conformal divergence. Our proposed approach includes a convenient surrogate (upper bound) loss of the exponential family PCA which has an easy to optimize form. We also derive the corresponding form for nonlinear autoencoders. Experiments on simulated data and microbiome data show the promise of our method."

        "To account for the nonlinearity due to the compositional nature of the data, we start from exponential family PCA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] that we augment with the compositional constraint and simplify the loss to be optimized via a generalization of a recent result [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] on Bregman divergences, which may be of independent interest.",

        "If we wish to perform PCA on the crude count data, while maintaining the clr transform, we need an additional normalization term, which requires us to obtain a gauged version of the Bregman divergence.",

        "What Corollary 5 shows is that we can solve the problem via a surrogate formulation using non transformed data but minimizing a loss which is that of a \u03c6-PCA transformed twice: first taking a perspective transform of the KL generator (KL) and having a weighted Bregman divergence minimization (g\u22121(.)).",
        "One can redefine the gauge as g(x) = j:xj>01/\u03c1, where \u03c1 = |{j : xj > 0}| so that g(x) is always positive and xis well defined on Sd \u222a \u2202Sd.
