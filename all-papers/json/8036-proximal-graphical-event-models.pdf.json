        "abstract": "Event datasets involve irregular occurrences of events over the timeline and are prevalent in numerous domains. We introduce proximal graphical event models (PGEMs) as a representation of such datasets. PGEMs belong to a broader family of graphical models that characterize relationships between various types of events; in a PGEM, the rate of occurrence of an event type depends only on whether or not its parents have occurred in the most recent history. The main advantage over state-of-the-art models is that learning is entirely data driven and without the need for additional inputs from the user, which can require knowledge of the domain such as choice of basis functions and hyper-parameters. We theoretically justify our learning of parental sets and their optimal windows, proposing sound and complete algorithms in terms of parent structure learning. We present efficient heuristics for learning PGEMs from data, demonstrating their effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets."

        "The log likelihood maximizing window wzx from parent Z to a node X is upper bounded by max{tzz}, where {t} denotes inter-event times, which is taken to include the inter-event time between the last arrival of Z and T.",
        "For a node X with a single parent Z, the log likelihood maximizing window wzx either belongs to or is a left limit of a window in the candidate set W \u2217 = {tzx} \u222a max{tzz}, where {t} denotes inter-event times.",
        "For a node X and parent(s) Y, the log likelihood maximizing window for a new parent Z, wzx, given the windows corresponding to nodes from Y to X, either belongs to or is a left limit of a window in the candidate set W \u2217 = {tzx} \u222a Cy,z, where {t} denotes inter-event times and Cy,z are change points across the set of the piecewise linear functions D(y, z) that are obtainable from Algorithm 1.",
        "We will use the above two theorems in our heuristics for finding the optimal windows and parameters given a parent set.",
        "With the optimal parent set search with bounded sizes and determination of optimal windows and conditional intensity rates given a graph, one can show the soundness and completeness of Algorithm 2 under mild assumptions.",
