        "abstract": "We study the problem of generalized uniformity testing of a discrete probability distribution: Given samples from a probability distribution p over an unknown size discrete domain \u03a9, we want to distinguish, with probability at least 2/3, between the case that p is uniform on some subset of \u03a9 versus -far, in total variation distance, from any such uniform distribution. We establish tight bounds on the sample complexity of generalized uniformity testing. In more detail, we present a computationally efficient tester whose sample complexity is optimal, within constant factors, and a matching worst-case information-theoretic lower bound. Specifically, we show that the sample complexity of generalized uniformity testing is \u0398 1/( 4/3 p 3) + 1/( 2 p 2) ."
