        "abstract": "Neural models operating over structured spaces such as knowledge graphs require a continuous embedding of the discrete elements of this space (such as entities) as well as the relationships between them. Relational embeddings with high expressivity, however, have high model complexity, making them computationally difficult to train. We propose a new family of embeddings for knowledge graphs that interpolate between a method with high model complexity and one, namely Holographic embeddings (HOLE), with low dimensionality and high training efficiency. This interpolation, termed HOLEX, is achieved by concatenating several linearly perturbed copies of original HOLE. We formally characterize the number of perturbed copies needed to provably recover the full entity-entity or entity-relation interaction matrix, leveraging ideas from Haar wavelets and compressed sensing. In practice, using just a handful of Haar-based or random perturbation vectors results in a much stronger knowledge completion system. On the Freebase FB15K dataset, HOLEX outperforms originally reported HOLE by 14.7% on the HITS@10 metric, and the current path-based state-of-the-art method, PTransE, by 4% (absolute)."

        "Given the importance of capturing rich correlations, we focus on two representative compositional operators that explicitly model the correlations among entities and relations: the full tensor product and the holographic embedding, described below.",
        "Theorem 1 states that if we could afford d perturbation vectors, HOLEX is equivalent to the full tensor product (RESCAL) matrix.",
        "We can prove that HOLEX using the first 2k rows of Hd yields an embedding that contains the partial sums of 2k equal-sized segments along each diagonal line of the tensor product matrix.",

        "Proposition 1 formalizes how HOLEX forms an interpolation between HOLE and the full tensor product as an increasing number of Haar wavelets is used as perturbation vectors.",
        "As suggested by Figure 1, HOLE perturbed with one such random 0/1 vector is equivalent to randomly zeroing out roughly half the d rows from the tensor product matrix, before summing along each diagonal line.",
