        "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of using machine-learned predictions to improve the performance of online algorithms. We consider two classical problems, ski rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling, and obtain new online algorithms that use predictions to make their decisions. These algorithms are oblivious to the performance of the predictor, improve with better predictions, but do not degrade much if the predictions are poor."

        "Dealing with uncertainty is one of the most challenging issues that real-world computational tasks, besides humans, face.",
        "For the ski rental problem with a predictor, we first obtain a deterministic online algorithm that is (1 + 1/\u03bb)-robust and (1 + \u03bb)-consistent (Section 2.2).",
        "For the non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, we obtain a randomized algorithm that is (2/(1 \u2212 \u03bb))-robust and (1/\u03bb)-consistent.",
        "We first show that an algorithm that naively uses the predicted number of days to decide whether or not to buy is 1-consistent, i.e., its competitive ratio is 1 when \u03b7 = 0.",
        "Algorithms 2 and 3 both yield a smooth trade-off between the robustness and consistency guarantees for the ski rental problem.",
        "When processing times are known up front, the optimal algorithm is to schedule the jobs in non-decreasing order of job lengths, i.e., shortest job first.",
        "A deterministic non-clairvoyant algorithm called round-robin (RR) yields a competitive ratio of 2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], which is known to be best possible.",
        "Our goal is to design algorithms that are both robust and consistent, i.e., can use good predictions to beat the lower bound of 2, while at the same time guaranteeing a worst-case constant competitive ratio.",
        "We call a non-clairvoyant scheduling algorithm monotonic if it has the following property: given two instances with identical inputs and actual job processing times (x1, .",
        "To get the best of both worlds, i.e. good performance for good predictions as well as a constant-factor approximation in the worst-case, we combine SPJF with RR using the following, calling the algorithm Preferential Round-Robin (PRR).",
        ", and, if SPJF happens to schedule the longest job first, increasing the completion time of n \u2212 1 jobs by each, ALG = OPT + (n \u2212 1) .",
        "Setting \u03bb > 0.5 gives an algorithm that beats the round-robin ratio of 2 in the case of sufficiently good predictions.",
        "Even our deterministic algorithm that uses the predictions performs better than the classical randomized algorithm for errors up to a standard deviation of 2b.",
        "In order to simulate predicted job lengths and compare the performance of the different algorithms with respect to the errors in the prediction, we set the predicted job length yi = xi + i, where i is drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation \u03c3.",
        "The na\u00efve strategy of scheduling jobs in non-decreasing order of their predicted job lengths (SPJF) performs very well when the errors are low, but quickly deteriorates as the errors increase.",
        "Another research direction would be to use the error distribution of the ML predictor to further improve the bounds"
