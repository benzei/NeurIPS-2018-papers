        "abstract": "Recently developed deep-learning-based denoisers often outperform state-of-the-art conventional denoisers, such as the BM3D. They are typically trained to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the output image of a deep neural network and a ground truth image. In deep learning based denoisers, it is important to use high quality noiseless ground truth data for high performance, but it is often challenging or even infeasible to obtain noiseless images in application areas such as hyperspectral remote sensing and medical imaging. In this article, we propose a method based on Stein\u2019s unbiased risk estimator (SURE) for training deep neural network denoisers only based on the use of noisy images. We demonstrate that our SURE-based method, without the use of ground truth data, is able to train deep neural network denoisers to yield performances close to those networks trained with ground truth, and to outperform the state-of-the-art denoiser BM3D. Further improvements were achieved when noisy test images were used for training of denoiser networks using our proposed SURE-based method."

        "Note that the DnCNN-BM3D method that trains networks by optimizing MSE with BM3D denoised images as the ground truth yielded slightly worse performance than the BM3D itself (Tables 3, 4).",
