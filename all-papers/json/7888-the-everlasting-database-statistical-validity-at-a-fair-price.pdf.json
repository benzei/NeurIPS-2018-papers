We propose a mechanism for answering an arbitrarily long sequence of potentially adaptive statistical queries, by charging a price for each query and using the proceeds to collect additional samples. Crucially, we guarantee statistical validity without any assumptions on how the queries are generated. We also ensure with high probability that the cost for M non-adaptive queries is O(log M ), while the cost to a potentially adaptive user who makes M",

        "VALIDATIONROUND uses a fixed number, n, of samples and with high probability returns accurate answers for at least exp (\u2326(n)) non-adaptive queries and \u2326 \u0303 (n2) adaptive queries.",

        "Unlike EVERLASTINGVALIDATION, which prioritized charging as little as possible for non-adaptive queries, EVERLASTINGTO increases the O cost to O in order to bound the price of arbitrary adaptive queries.",
