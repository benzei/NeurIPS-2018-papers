        "abstract": "Despite the impressive recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, their deployment to real-world physical systems is often complicated by unexpected events, limited data, and the potential for expensive failures. In this paper, we describe an application of RL \u201cin the wild\u201d to the task of regulating temperatures and airflow inside a large-scale data center (DC). Adopting a data-driven, modelbased approach, we demonstrate that an RL agent with little prior knowledge is able to effectively and safely regulate conditions on a server floor after just a few hours of exploration, while improving operational efficiency relative to existing PID controllers."

    "summary": [
        "Among approaches in the literature, the most relevant to our problem is linear quadratic (LQ) control.",
        "The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that a controller relying on a coarse-grained linear dynamics model can safely, effectively, and cost-efficiently regulate conditions in a large-scale commercial data center, after just a few hours of learning and with minimal prior knowledge.",
        "The existing cooling system relies on local PID controllers, which are manually tuned and regulate DP measured at nearby sensors and LAT measured at the same AHU.",
        "Controlling CAT instead of LAT is more complicated, as temperatures along the server racks take a longer time to respond to changes in controls and depend on multiple AHUs. Since the local controllers operate independently, they may settle into a suboptimal state where some AHUs do little work while others run at their maximum capacity to compensate.",
        "We: (i) model the effect of each AHU on state variables in a large neighborhood rather than on just the closest sensors; control CAT directly rather using LAT as a proxy; and jointly optimize all controls instead of using independent local controllers.",
        "The large size of the server floor allows us to assume that temperatures and DPs at each location directly depend only states, controls, and disturbances at nearby locations.1 Additional parameter sparsity can be imposed based on variable types; for example, we know that DP directly",
        "Qs and rc are the weights for the loss w.r.t. state and control variables s and c, respectively, and i ranges over AHUs. We assume that disturbances do not change over time.",
        "Figure 4 shows histograms of states and disturbances during the operation of the three controllers, with data aggregated over both time and sensors.",
        "While precise quantification of these savings requires longer-term experiments, our approach of jointly optimizing controls of all AHUs, together with the ability to control process variables at slightly higher values, has the potential to save about 9% of the current server-floor cooling costs.",
        "We have demonstrated that a simple linear model identified from only a few hours of exploration suffices for effective regulation of temperatures and airflow on a large-scale server floor.",
        "In terms of overall data center operational efficiency, further advantages are almost certainly achievable achieved by jointly controlling AHUs and the range of disturbance variables if possible, or by planning AHU control according to known/predicted disturbances values rather than treating them as noise."
