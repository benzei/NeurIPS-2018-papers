        "abstract": "Feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for object classification tasks such as ImageNet. Further, they are quantitatively accurate models of temporally-averaged responses of neurons in the primate brain\u2019s visual system. However, biological visual systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical CNNs: local recurrence within cortical areas, and long-range feedback from downstream areas to upstream areas. Here we explored the role of recurrence in improving classification performance. We found that standard forms of recurrence (vanilla RNNs and LSTMs) do not perform well within deep CNNs on the ImageNet task. In contrast, novel cells that incorporated two structural features, bypassing and gating, were able to boost task accuracy substantially. We extended these design principles in an automated search over thousands of model architectures, which identified novel local recurrent cells and long-range feedback connections useful for object recognition. Moreover, these task-optimized ConvRNNs matched the dynamics of neural activity in the primate visual system better than feedforward networks, suggesting a role for the brain\u2019s recurrent connections in performing difficult visual behaviors."

        "The visual system of the brain must discover meaningful patterns in a complex physical world [James, 1890].",
        "We attempted to extend the method of goal-driven modeling from solving tasks with feedforward CNNs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYamins_2016_a\" href=\"#rYamins_2016_a\">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</a>] or RNNs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMante_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rMante_et+al_2013_a\">Mante et al, 2013</a>] to explain dynamics in the primate visual system, resulting in convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs).",
        "Adding other recurrent cell structures from the literature, including the UGRNN and IntersectionRNN [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCollins_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rCollins_et+al_2017_a\">Collins et al, 2017</a>], had similar effects to adding LSTMs. This suggested that standard RNN cell structures, well-suited for a range of temporal tasks, are less well-suited for inclusion within deep CNNs. We speculated that this was because standard cells lack a combination of two key properties: (1) Gating, in which the value of a hidden state determines how much of the bottom-up input is passed through, retained, or discarded at the time step; and (2) Bypassing, where a zero-initialized hidden state allows feedforward input to pass on to the layer unaltered, as in the identity shortcuts of ResNet-class architectures (Figure 2a, top left).",
        "These models used both bypassing and gating within their local RNN cells; depth-separable convolutions for updating hidden states, but conventional convolutions for connecting bottom-up input to output (Figure 4a); and several key long-range feedbacks, which were \u201cdiscovered\u201d early in the search, subsequently used in the majority of models (Figure 4b).",
        "While these recurrent dynamics could be used for tasks involving time, here we optimized the ConvRNNs to perform the \u201cstatic\u201d task of object classification on ImageNet. It is possible that the primate visual system is optimized for such a task, because even static images reliably produce dynamic neural response trajectories [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cIssa_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rIssa_et+al_2018_a\">Issa et al, 2018</a>].",
        "If this were the case, recurrent networks trained to perform a difficult, static object recognition task might explain neural dynamics in the primate visual system, just as feedforward models explain time-averaged responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYamins_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rYamins_et+al_2014_a\">Yamins et al, 2014</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKhaligh-Razavi_2014_a\" href=\"#rKhaligh-Razavi_2014_a\">Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014</a>].",
        "Because the feedforward model has the same square wave dynamics as its 100ms visual input, it cannot predict neural responses after image offset plus a fixed delay, corresponding to the number of layers (Figure 5c, dashed black lines).",
        "We extend a core result from the feedforward to the recurrent regime: given an appropriate architecture class, task-driven convolutional recurrent neural networks provide the best normative models of encoding dynamics in the primate visual system.",
        "Some firing rate dynamics may result from neuronal biophysics rather than recurrent connections between neurons, models with task-optimized neuronal time constants at each convolutional layer did not predict neural dynamics as well as ConvRNNs (Figure 5c)."
