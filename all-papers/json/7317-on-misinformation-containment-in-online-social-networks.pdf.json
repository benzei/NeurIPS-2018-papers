        "abstract": "The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages. The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. This paper makes four contributions. First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of \u03a9(2log1\u2212 n4 ) in polynomial time unless N P \u2286 DT IM E(npolylog n). Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results."

        "The past years have witnessed a drastic increase in the usage of online social networks.",
        "Have considered this problem for the case when there is one misinformation cascade and one positive cascade [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
        "As shown later in Sec. 5, adding more seed nodes for the positive cascade may surprisingly cause a wider spread of misinformation, i.e., the objective function is not monotone nondecreasing.",
        "Consider the network shown in Fig. 1 where there are three cascades C1, C2 and C3, of which the seed sets are {v1}, {v2} and {v3}, respectively.",
        "An instance of the above problems is given by (1) G = (V, E): a network structure; (2) {pe|pe \u2208 [0, 1], e \u2208 E}: the probabilities on the edges; (3) C = M \u222a P \u222a{P\u2217}: the set of the existing cascades together with P\u2217; (4) {Fv(C)|v \u2208 V, C \u2208 C}: the cascade priority at each node; (5) {\u03c4 (C) \u2286 V |C \u2208 M \u222a P}: the seed sets of the existing cascades; (6) V \u2217 \u2286 V : a candidate set of the seed nodes of P\u2217.",
        "Consider the network shown in Fig. 3, where there exists one positive cascade P1 and one misinformation cascade M1.",
        "Suppose that the probability on each edge is equal to 1, \u03c4 (P1) = {v1} and \u03c4 (M1) = {v7}, and the cascade priority at v3 and v5 is given as shown in the figure.",
        "In the rest of this section, we first study three special cascade priorities and design an algorithm for the general setting.",
        "While the Max-M problem does not exhibit any good property in general, it is monotone nondecreasing and submodular under special cascade priority settings.",
        "For the general cascade priority, we present a data-dependent approximation algorithm based on the upper-lower-bound technique [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
        "For a seed set \u03c4 (P\u2217) \u2286 V \u2217 of cascade P\u2217, we use f (\u03c4 (P\u2217)))) to denote the expected number of the M-active nodes when each node v replaces its cascade priority Fv by Fv. Because Fv is P-dominant and Fv is M-dominant, the following result immediately follows from Theorem 2.",
        "From Example 3 and the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 we can see that the non-submodularity only occurs in the case when two or more cascades arrive at one node at the same time.",
        "We propose three types of cascade priority and show that the MC problem can be close to submodular optimization problems.",
        "An effective algorithm for solving the MC problem is designed and evaluated by experiments"
